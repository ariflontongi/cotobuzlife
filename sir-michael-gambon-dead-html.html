A natural talent for the craft, he soon rose through the ranks of professionals, landing himself the honor of becoming one of the very first members of Laurence Olifier’s National Theatre acting company in London.</p><p><strong>Sir Michael Gambon’s work on TV landed him four BAFTA Awards and two Emmy Award nominations as well as a spot at number 27 on The Irish Times’ list of the country’s greatest on-screen actors.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>His work on the stage saw him perform in a slew of titles, including The Crucible, Saint Joan, Henry VIII, Richard III, King Lear, Antony and Cleopatra, and many more. He would nab three Olivier awards for his work in the theater.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Dumbledore-Harry-Potter-900x507.jpg><p>A man of many talents, Sir Michael Gambon easily crossed into the realm of <a class=wpil_keyword_link href=# rel=noopener title=television data-wpil-keyword-link=linked>television</a> while he was also busy breaking a leg on stage. While he held roles in TV productions during the ‘60s and ‘70s, it would be with 1986’s The Singing Detective that put Gambon’s small-screen career on a real upward trajectory.</p><p><strong>Sir Michael Gambon, best known for his role as Professor Albus Dumbledore in the Harry Potter franchise, passed away at 82.</strong></p><p>From here, the actor would appear in titles including Wives and Daughters, Longitude, Perfect Strangers, Path to War, Emma, Cranford, and The Casual Vacancy. His work on TV landed him four BAFTA Awards and two Emmy Award nominations, as well as a spot at number 27 on The Irish Times’ list of the country’s greatest on-screen actors.&nbsp;</p><p>Just as he made his way onto the stage, Sir Michael Gambon also celebrated his film debut in Stuart Burge’s 1965 film, Othello. From there, he was cast in films throughout the ‘60s and ‘70s, but, like his TV career, it was the ‘80s and beyond that really saw Gambon turn into a legend.</p><p><strong>Gambon stepped into the role of Dumbledor after the original actor, Richard Harris, passed away in 2002.</strong></p><p>Included in the star’s list of credits are titles such as The Cook, the Thief, His Wife & Her Lover, The Wings of the Dove, The Insider, The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou, Gosford Park, Amazing Grace, The Fantastic Mr. Fox, The King’s Speech, Quartet, and Victoria & Abdul.</p><p>And then, we get to Sir Michael Gambon’s portrayal of Professor Albus Dumbledore in the <a href=#>Harry Potter</a> franchise. Gambon stepped into the role after the original actor, Richard Harris, passed away in 2002.
