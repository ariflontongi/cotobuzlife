Players will encounter Delgado as one of the Non-Playable Characters (NPCs) in the Settled Systems as they progress through the game. Delgado holds a pivotal position within the Crimson Fleet, serving as its leader. The Crimson Fleet is a prominent faction in the game, and players are tasked with infiltrating The Lock, a former prison location, alongside Delgado and another recruit named Mathis.</p><p class=has-text-align-left>The mission at The Lock serves two main objectives – to determine if the player and Mathis have what it takes to become members of the Crimson Fleet and to search for a legendary treasure known as Kryx’s Legacy. Delgado is driven by a deep desire to locate this treasure, and it is during this mission that Mathis sees an opportunity to eliminate Delgado. However, Mathis cannot accomplish this task alone and requires the player’s assistance.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-should-you-betray-delgado-starfield>Should You Betray Delgado Starfield?</h2><p class=has-text-align-left>In Starfield, the decision to betray Delgado or side with Mathis in the Crimson Fleet does not significantly impact the overall progression or storyline of the game. During the mission at The Lock, Mathis suggests stealing Kryx’s Legacy from Delgado and taking over leadership of the Crimson Fleet. However, regardless of the player’s response to Mathis’s proposal, the outcome remains the same.</p><p class=has-text-align-left>Mathis will either back out of the plan or express frustration with the player’s decision, but there is no opportunity to actually kill Delgado during this mission. After completing the mission and returning to The Key, players will have a conversation with Delgado about what transpired. Here, players can choose to recommend that Mathis leave the fleet or stand up for him by saying he did well at The Lock. However, these choices also do not lead to significant consequences in the game’s progression.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-impact-of-betrayal-in-starfield>The Impact of Betrayal in Starfield</h2><p class=has-text-align-left>While betraying Delgado may not have a direct impact on the game’s overall progression, it does add an extra layer of depth and intrigue to the storyline. The choice to betray Delgado highlights the moral ambiguity present in the game and raises questions about loyalty, trust, and the pursuit of personal gain.</p><p class=has-text-align-left>By choosing to betray Delgado, players align themselves with Mathis and potentially set themselves on a path of power and control within the Crimson Fleet. This choice may appeal to players who value personal ambition and are willing to take risks to advance their own interests. On the other hand, players who choose to remain loyal to Delgado may prioritize loyalty and honor above personal gain.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-exploring-the-consequences-of-betraying-delgado-starfield>Exploring the Consequences of Betraying Delgado Starfield</h2><p class=has-text-align-left>The world of Starfield is vast and filled with intricate storylines and compelling characters. One such character is Delgado Starfield, a central figure in the game’s quest line. As players progress through the game, they will encounter Delgado, who holds a pivotal position within the Crimson Fleet, a prominent faction in the game. Delgado’s character and the choices surrounding him present players with a moral dilemma that adds depth and intrigue to their gameplay experience.</p><p class=has-text-align-left>In the mission at The Lock, players are presented with the choice to betray Delgado or side with Mathis, another recruit. The primary objective of the mission is to determine the player’s potential to become a member of the Crimson Fleet and search for the legendary treasure, Kryx’s Legacy. Mathis sees an opportunity to eliminate Delgado during this mission, but he requires the player’s assistance to carry out his dangerous plan.</p><p class=has-text-align-left>Interestingly, the choice to betray Delgado or side with Mathis has minimal impact on the overall progression or storyline of the game. Regardless of the player’s decision, the outcome remains the same. This raises questions about the significance of player choices in games and the potential for branching storylines. While the lack of consequences may disappoint some players, others may appreciate the freedom to explore different paths without fear of missing out on crucial elements of the game.</p><p class=has-text-align-left>The choice to betray Delgado highlights the complex nature of morality within the game. Players must weigh the potential benefits of aligning with Mathis and gaining power within the Crimson Fleet against the loyalty and honor of remaining true to Delgado. This choice taps into the player’s values and forces them to confront the moral ambiguities present in the game’s universe.</p><p class=has-text-align-left>In Starfield, the decision to betray Delgado Starfield may not have a substantial impact on the overall progression or storyline of the game. However, it does add depth and intrigue to the player’s gameplay experience. By exploring the moral dilemmas presented by this choice, players are forced to confront their own values and priorities, ultimately shaping their character’s journey through the game.</p><p class=has-text-align-left>Whether players opt to betray Delgado or stand by him, the significance of this choice lies in the unique personal narrative they shape for their character. The liberty to make decisions and embark on diverse paths is what distinguishes Starfield as an immersive and captivating gaming adventure.
