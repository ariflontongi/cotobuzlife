U.S. District Judge Michael Fitzgerald found they weren’t, concluding that the allegedly infringing lines are “short phrases that lack the modicum of originality and creativity” required to allege copyright infringement. He dismissed the suit.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“[B]y 2001, American popular culture was heavily steeped in the concepts of players, haters, and player haters,” Fitzgerald wrote. “The concept of actors acting in accordance with their essential nature is not at all creative; it is banal.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">But a federal appeals court <a href=#>revived the case</a>, concluding that the federal judge’s dismissal was premature.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“By concluding that, ‘for such short phrases to be protected under the Copyright Act, they must be more creative than the lyrics at issues here,’ the district court constituted itself as the final judge of the worth of an expressive work,” the three judge panel wrote. “Because the absence of originality is not established either on the face of the complaint or through the judicially noticed matters, we reverse the district court’s dismissal.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">An attorney for Hall and Butler didn’t respond to a request for comment.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue8GuqqKmlajAcK7UrKCnnaOoeq%2Bx1qxmrZmpobyzedKwoJ%2BsXai1orfEZqCtZZ%2Bbs26vzqmwq6GXncFuv9Siq2arlanBrbHSZpmenp%2Bnsm7A0aKYpWVhZ4B2fpdpbW1tXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
