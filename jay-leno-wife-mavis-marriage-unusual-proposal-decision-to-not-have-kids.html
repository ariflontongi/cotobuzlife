Firstly, Mavis never thought she would get married; she explained to <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>People</a> in 1987: "It was a big thing with me, part of my vehement feminism. But with Jay, I began to realize that this was the first time I was ever with someone where I had a perfect, calm sense of having arrived at my destination."</p><p id=eVdM9Lo_446 data-wc=19><strong>MORE:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Jay Leno talks surprising retirement plans as he continues to recover from terrifying car fire and motorcycle crash</a></p><p id=eyN-_TggghSJ data-wc=46>Jay was also likely unlike anyone she had ever met, which he proved early on in their relationship. The comedian has never been a drinker, and his wife still remembers him offering her $35 to go shopping instead of getting her a cocktail at the bar.</p><p id=evElLMMuRcKD data-wc=88>Their engagement was no less peculiar: rather than the traditional engagement ring, Jay proposed with an insurance plan for the couple. He also explained to the s: <strong>"I had this insurance policy, and I thought if something happened to me, my girlfriend wouldn't be covered, but if we're married, we're covered, so… we might as well get married. Not the most romantic,"</strong> and Mavis added: "He was going to get me [an engagement ring], but we had just bought a house, so why would I do that?"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/9ebdebfca5ba-gettyimages-491834200.jpg><h2 dir=ltr><strong>Does Jay Leno have kids?</strong></h2><p id=elq1TNkmR07O data-wc=51>Jay and Mavis never had kids together, which Mavis has said is something she decided on when she was a kid herself.

It's perfectly obvious the women are the ones trapped."</p><p id=eknsXWLJrexd data-wc=32></p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
