The former <a class=hm-link href=#>Coronation Street</a> star, who's set to front brand new BBC One programme <a class=hm-link href=#>The Bidding Room</a>, sadly lost his wife in 2004 after a 15-year marriage. During an appearance on Loose Women back in 2017, Nigel revealed that Polly found out she had ovarian cancer after having a hysterectomy. "It was that sudden," he said. "It was a major shock as you can imagine. That's a very tough one to get."</p><p id=epUPDoB9TCOs data-wc=59>The actor accompanied his wife to the hospital for her appointments, recalling: "The first doctor that we saw we didn't really like. His manner was a bit brusque. So we went somewhere else and we found someone who was wonderful, so that's also important." As patron of The Eve Appeal, Nigel, 65, urged couples to talk about gynaecological problems.&nbsp;</p><p id=epEhN8cNMjVv data-wc=1><strong>MORE:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>Normal People stars Paul Mescal and Daisy Edgar-Jones are working together again</a></strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/c32756ded70f-nigel-and-polly-z.jpg><p id=eoqVCNjQJHPf data-wc=8><strong>Nigel lost his wife to cancer in 2004</strong></p><p id=ex1lbJxZEVFF data-wc=87>"Men, apparently, are a million miles from talking about that today. They find it embarrassing," he said. "If you have a problem, discuss it because it's all about early diagnosis. It really does make a difference. Don't keep it to yourself, talk about it with your husband and your partner. There should be no embarrassment." Loose Women panellist Andrea McLean praised the actor at the time&nbsp;for bringing up the issue, saying: "I think it's wonderful that you, as a man, are championing this, I really do."&nbsp;</p><p id=e8MvSQ5e3qCj data-wc=1><strong>MORE:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>Dad's Army cast then and now: see which actors played the iconic roles in the film adaptation</a></strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/6be63c10f7f3-nigel-havers-reads-letter-z.jpg><p id=eEZLBIv5WCtB data-wc=11><strong>The actor presented a letter from Princess Diana&nbsp;on the show</strong></p><p id=eY19iy97nVFl data-wc=72>The TV star, who has since found love with Georgiana Bronfman, also spoke about his friendship with the late Princess Diana. He showed the panellists a thank you letter that Diana had sent him after he gave her a watch for her birthday. "I did some charity work for her and she was just wonderful to be around," said Nigel. "She was immensely attractive so you felt very good in her company."</p><p id=eYmnmxhfic9n data-wc=14><strong>Like this story?<a class=hm-link href=#> Sign up to our newsletter</a> to get other stories like this delivered straight to your inbox.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfm7atuY5rZ2toYGt9eYWQamxvZ56etKa4jKGYr52iqHq4tcWeZKmnnKHGbrDEmquhZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
