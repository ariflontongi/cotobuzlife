Some are based on social norms, personal reasons, cultural, religious, age factor, and current fashion trends. Some of the main reasons include the listed below.</p><h3>Looks great on others</h3><p class=align-left>Have you ever seen a particular celebrity, an online model, or just a random person, and loved how their cartilage piercings look great on them? That instant attraction of their look happens to be one of the main reasons why most individuals tend to fall in love with specific looks and inspire to have them. When you love something, it makes you see beyond the pain and makes you believe that it will completely change your appearance.</p><h3>Self-expression</h3><p class=align-left>Cartilage perforations are quite useful when you want to make a silent but visible statement. A good example is an expression of being “courageous.” Having multiple perforations is enough evidence that you can boldly face pain and overcome it. On the other hand, it can be used to express one's sense of creativity. A good example is the “Rock and Roll” artists. They complement their dressing with their piercings to achieve that “gothic” look as a hard-rock or metal artist.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/2faa57fa890010a3.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Top 50 cool bear tattoo design ideas and meanings for your inspiration</span></p></a><h3>Sense of belonging</h3><p class=align-left>We live in a world where different individuals believe or do numerous things tend concerning their spiritual or poetical aspects. Various worldwide communities tend to view piercings as normality in their cultural practices. A perforation on a specific area or a particular number of piercings depending on the gender could mean something in a given setup of a community.</p><h3>In memory of either specific individuals or activities</h3><p class=align-left>I know a good number of people who got a piercing when they turned 18 years old. My sister is one of those. Every time someone asks her why she got the perforation, she smiles and looks back at her 18th birthday. Furthermore, some individuals get perforations to remember their relationships, anniversary, or even tragic events.</p><h3>Achieve uniqueness</h3><p class=align-left>The fact remains that we could both have the same piercings but either different jewellery or different styles. There are various styles, places, and even numbers of cartilage piercings to choose for your beauty. Depending on your taste of style, you can achieve your desired uniqueness.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/699bdc66d230110e.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Conch piercing: Everything you need to know</span></p></a><h2>Ear cartilage piercing</h2><p class=align-left>Helix piercing involves making a perforation of the upper ear that is known as a helix. The helix is the extension of the cartilage that exists from just above the earlobe, to the apex, and finally curved as it comes into contact with the head. A forward helix piercing involves the part between the helix’s top and where it meets the head.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/d85a947d88ae9f58.jpg><p class=align-left>Others include Industrial, Antihelix, Rook that is done on the upper side of the antihelix, Snug that is done on the lower ridge, Conch, Daith, Tragus, Antitragus, and California.</p><h2>Nose cartilage piercings</h2><p class=align-left>Just like the ear, the nose also is composed of cartilage. As a result, several beauty nose perforations can be done to achieve that exclusive look. A good example is the “Nostril piercing” that can be done on either nose penetrating to the inside part of the nose. Others types of nose perforations include high nostril piercing that is done on the furthest side of the nose that is closer to the bone, nose tip, nasallang, and the septum perforation.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/471200a3ff3a8d10.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Top 50 elephant tattoo ideas with meanings</span></p></a><h2>Cartilage piercing process</h2><p class=align-left>If you are new and have never had a body piercing, then I bet you must wonder what the process might involve. Let us face it; it is very typical to experience a mixed feeling of both excitement and fear. You can take it from me and other experts in perforation and especially cartilage piercings, the process ends faster as soon as it begins.</p><p class=align-left>You will first have to decide or select the person that you feel comfortable with making the piercing. The piercer will then have to put on surgical gloves and later proceed to sterilise the specific body part to be perforated. Sterilisation is vital to prevent any infectious diseases that might result during the process. You should also insist on sterilisation as prevention is better than cure.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>How to get white eyes: top 5 ways</p><p class=align-left>The next step is a piercer identifying and marking the specific section of the ear or nose that you want to be pierced. This is after asking you and ensuring that it is a particular region. After reaching an agreement, a piercer uses a surgical marker to make a reference mark as it prevents any alterations.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/3c6ca32335e277f7.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Easy steps to follow on how to pierce your nose at home</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The next stage is a piercer using a hollow needle to make the perforation. Immediately a piercer pulls out the needle, he/she proceed to insert your jewellery of choice. Some beauty parlours may use advanced assistance from body clamps to ensure that your skin stays intact during the process.</p><h2>Cartilage piercing pain</h2><p class=align-left>Since the procedure takes only a few minutes, the pain level is also quite insignificant. On a scale of 1-10, most people rank the ear cartilage <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">pain to be 4/10</a>. During the incursion, expect to experience a spontaneous sharp pain that fades in seconds. The post cartilage piercing period greatly determines the pain level and success of the piercing.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/2faa57fa890010a3.jpg><p class=align-left>In most incidences, when the entire ear feels excessively sore, swollen, or develops a bump, it is a sign that your piercing has developed an infection. In two weeks, the pain should decrease as a sign of healing. This will significantly depend on the aftercare maintenance as explained below.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt5dvaro2i1o7.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Style your short bob braids in a trendy way in 2018</span></p></a><h2>Ear cartilage piercings healing process</h2><p class=align-left>So, does cartilage heal? Healing may differ from one person to another. Just like pain, some people are tolerant of high pain levels while others cannot entertain the thought of pain. Generally, a healthy lifestyle and perforation care is the only routine to achieve a properly healed perforation. Ensure that you take a healthy diet for adequate blood flow since the cartilage receives quite a little blood compared to the rest of the body.</p><h2>Cartilage piercing care</h2><p class=align-left>Avoid any scenarios that might have water getting inside the fresh perforation. This involves using a shower cape that covers up your ear and also avoiding swimming or being rained on.</p><p class=align-left>You will also have to consider your sleeping posture.

You will time and again find the wound to be itchy. This might lead to continuous touching hence infection with dirty or unwashed hands. Constant touching also leads to increased pain and wound infections.</p><p class=align-left>Any developing crust or body fluid closer to the earning should be attended to using a disinfectant. Do not use your bare hands as it might cause infection. It is advisable to use cotton dipped in a disinfectant.</p><h2>Cleaning process</h2><p class=align-left>The best solution to apply is a<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> saline solution</a> that can either be homemade or bought on a chemist. Cartilage piercing heals faster when high standards of cleanliness are maintained. The cleaning procedure should be done <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">twice in 24 hours</a>. The process should continue for the first 1-3 months and only stopped when one no longer feels the pain.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/747c94c95ab26864.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Latest Ankara styles for babies: 30+ adorable styles to try</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/699bdc66d230110e.jpg><p class=align-left>After healing, you are now capable of exploring a large variety of jewellery.
