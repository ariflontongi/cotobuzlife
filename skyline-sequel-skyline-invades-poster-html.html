Ready or not, it appears that Beyond Skyline is in fact happening. We reported a while back that the 2010 film Skyline, which was one of the worst reviewed films of the year, is getting a sequel some years after the fact for some reason. And now, just to prove that this is actually going down, the first poster for the film no one expected has appeared."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

We reported a while back that the 2010 film <i>Skyline</i>, which was one of the worst reviewed films of the year, is getting a sequel some years after the fact for some reason. And now, just to prove that this is actually going down, the <a href=#>first poster</a> for the film no one expected has appeared.</p><p>My first thought when I saw this (after the why, why, why that is) was that the image on this poster looks a little bit like the alien hunter from <i><a href=#>Predator</a></i>, what with that giant claw and everything. This one doesn’t look like it has the ability to retract, which seems like it would be a problem, practically speaking (imagine trying to reach into your pocket for change), but it sure looks badass and is the kind of thing that probably comes in handy during combat.<span id=more-109057></span></p><p>This is happening regardless of how anyone feels, but what the hell, maybe it’ll be awesome. <i>Beyond Skyline</i> will star Frank Grillo, and the last time he took over the sequel to a low-budget genre movie I didn’t like (<i><a href=#>The Purge</a></i>), I totally dug the results (I didn’t expect to enjoy <i><a href=#>The Purge: Anarchy</a></i> nearly as much as I did). He’s got that grizzled 1970s badass thing down pat, and there should be plenty of opportunity for him to showcase that here. And if he’s fighting aliens, all the better.</p><p>While we don’t know too much about the plot details, the reports seem to indicate that <i>Beyond Skyline</i> will relate to <i>Skyline</i> much in the same way <i>The Purge: Anarchy</i> relates to <i>The Purge</i>. From what we’ve heard, the action in the sequel takes place at the same time as the story from the first film, and shows another side of the alien invasion.</p><p><i>Skyline</i> was produced on the cheap, and despite the critical thrashing it received (even viewer ratings were not good), it did make money. Not tons, which is probably why it took this long for a follow up, but it was profitable. Produced for $10 million, and it shows, it earned $21 million domestically, and $66 million globally. What’s strange is that this took so long. When <i>The Purge</i> was a hit, <i>Anarchy</i> was in theaters barely a year later to capitalize on the hype. All people remember about <i>Skyline</i> is that it was bad.</p><p>This does scream passion project, though. Liam O’Donnell, who wrote the first film, is directing the sequel, and he’s teaming up with Joshua Cordes, who collaborated on the script for the last installment. So maybe they were able to convince someone to back them.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/zz33-578x289.jpg alt="Frank Grillo" width=578 height=289 sizes="(max-width: 578px) 100vw, 578px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto>There’s no timeframe for <i>Beyond Skyline</i>, but we’ll let you know when we hear something more, which shouldn’t be too long since it has an eye on a 2015 release.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue8Snq2irk56zqnvSpLCloZ6aerSx0K6cpWWjoMattc2eZKKmppaxpr%2BMqaasrJWne6nAzKU%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
