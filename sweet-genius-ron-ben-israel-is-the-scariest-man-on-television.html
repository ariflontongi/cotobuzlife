Ron Ben-Israel, the host of Food Network’s bizarre culinary competition series Sweet Genius, absolutely terrifies me. Watching the show reduces me to cold sweat, imagining that Ben-Israel has forced me into the Saw-like confines of the Sweet Genius set, where I must bake a génoise while he cackles eagerly at my misery before murdering me.
Sweet Genius is a variation on the network’s highly successful Chopped: Four chefs—pastry chefs and confectionary makers in this case—must cook three courses from pre-selected mystery ingredients, and one chef gets eliminated each round, leading to a final showdown between the last two competitors."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Watching the show reduces me to cold sweat, imagining that Ben-Israel has forced me into the <i>Saw</i>-like confines of the <i>Sweet Genius</i> set, where I must bake a génoise while he cackles eagerly at my misery before murdering me.</p><p><i>Sweet Genius</i> is a variation on the network’s highly successful <i><a class="LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external" href=#>Chopped</a></i>: Four chefs—pastry chefs and confectionary makers in this case—must cook three courses from pre-selected mystery ingredients, and one chef gets eliminated each round, leading to a final showdown between the last two competitors. This is hardly a novel conceit (in fact the entire show seems to be a direct reaction to Bravo’s <i><a class="LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external" href=#>Top Chef: Just Desserts</a></i>), but here the courses—or “tests” to borrow the<i> Sweet Genius </i>parlance—are composed of chocolate, candy, and cake rounds, and the judge may cause you to wet your pants in fright, even if you’re not appearing on the show.</p><p>Overseeing the action from a thronelike place of power on a raised dais, Ben-Israel seems to be a cross between <i><a class="LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external" href=#>Fringe</a></i>’s <a class="LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external" href=#>Observers</a>—chromelike baldpates whose alienlike eyes skim over the action but never quite connect with it—and <i>Austin Powers</i>’s Bond-villain spoof <a class="LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external" href=#>Dr. Evil</a>, given their similar physical appearances, fondness for wearing purple-blue and self-serious natures.</p><p>It’s the last element that’s the most troubling. While there’s clearly an overt aura of enforced theatricality to the proceedings, Ben-Israel takes his persona a little too far. There’s the spine-chilling way in which he tastes elements of the contestants’ dishes with an <a class="LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external" href=#>insane amount of fastidiousness</a>, as though he were solving a complex differential equation or dissecting a victim rather than, well, eating candy. Adding to this sense of unease is the way with which Ben-Israel speaks, an exaggerated blend of winking coyness and thunderous voice of evil, announcing the inspiration for the dish (Ballerinas! Live baby chicks! A ventriloquist dummy!) and the way in which he slams his hand down on the large, overtly cake-shaped button that controls the show’s conveyer belt.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop><p>Oh, yes, did I forget to mention the mechanized conveyer belt? Ben-Israel’s command over the competition enables him to send out additional mandatory mystery ingredients (“You must now include a Peking duck in your desserts!” he cries out, missing only a silent-film-villain mustache to twirl menacingly), forcing the contestants to change directions instantly and further complicate a dish that might already contain <a class="LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external" href=#>chocolate</a>, water chestnuts, and mangoes. One of these times, I expect a severed human head to emerge as one of these new ingredients.</p><p>The presence of the conveyer belt does nothing to reduce Ben-Israel’s Dr. Evil-esque tendencies. Though devoid of a white fluffy cat in his lap, he nonetheless appears to be engaged in some sort of Austin Powers/James Bond relationship with the deathtrap nature of the mechanical conveyance. When the contestants ponder how they’re going to incorporate, say, foul-smelling durian fruit or squid ink into a chocolate cake (the silent question of “Do you expect me to cook with this?” hovering in the air), you can almost hear Ben-Israel whisper malevolently, “No, I expect you to die …” as his dark eyes glitter with a sharp malice.</p><p>(One plus: In its second season, <i>Sweet Genius</i> fortunately ejected a disembodied female computerized voice, which had informed the audience about the background and qualities of these ingredients. Possibly because the presence of a female artificial intelligence took things too far into the science-fiction realm, injecting yet another strain of creepiness into a show already overflowing with it.)</p><p>In real life, Ben-Israel is ex-Israeli military, a former dancer, and an über-successful pastry chef. He’s the owner of Manhattan’s renowned <a class="LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external" href=#>Ron Ben-Israel Cakes</a>, a firm celebrated for their insanely gorgeous wedding cakes and lifelike sugar flowers. He’s supremely talented, a visionary pastry chef <a class="LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external" href=#>plucked from relative obscurity by Martha Stewart</a>. And he’s proven, such as by his <a class="LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external" href=#>guest appearance</a> during Season 2 of Bravo’s <i>Top Chef: Just Desserts</i>, that he doesn’t always stick to his sinister shtick with such severity.</p><p>But when he’s placed into the <a class="LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external" href=#>ridiculous arenalike setting of <i>Sweet Genius</i></a>, it seems as though Ben-Israel’s persona as an outré Bond villain emerges only too willingly, reducing an already tedious show to the level of ridiculousness.</p><p>What we’re left with is the strangest reality host on television—a Pinhead for the pastry-cream set.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEnZiipKmXsqK%2F02eaqKVflr%2B1tcKlnKxnYmV%2Bc3uPbWZrbl%2BoxKax02aenqaZqsBuvs6nZJudnmK2tL7AnqNmoaNiwamxjKyamqqZmsC1ecyapWannmLBprjEr6CsoZ%2Bj</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
