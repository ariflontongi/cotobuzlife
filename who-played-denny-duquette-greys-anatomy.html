He logged a long list of acting credits on shows such as "Supernatural" and "The Good Wife" before scoring a main role as Negan Smith on the hit AMC series "The Walking Dead" in 2016.</p><p>And just like his character on "Grey's Anatomy," Morgan's character made a surprise return to TV. Months after "The Walking Dead" ended its 11-season run, Morgan starred in a six-episode spinoff, <a href=#>"The Walking Dead: Dead City."</a> But he almost turned it down. "If you had told me that a year ago that I would be doing it, I would've said, 'There's no way. I'm going to end this and walk away,'" Morgan admitted to <a href=#>Entertainment Weekly</a> in 2022. "But the story was so good and so worth telling that it simply came down to, I couldn't say no. And I felt invigorated and wanted to continue it."</p><p>While his days as Denny Duquette are long done, Morgan does have a personal connection to "Grey's." The actor is married to fellow TV star Hilarie Burton. Burton&nbsp;appeared on&nbsp;three episodes of "Grey's Anatomy" in 2013 playing plastic surgeon Dr. Lauren Boswell.</p><p>During a 2018 appearance on <a href=#>"The Howard Stern Show,"</a> Morgan revealed that he helped deliver the two children he shares with Burton.&nbsp;The family lives on a farm update New York where they raise donkeys, alpacas, and other animals. On the side, the actor co-owns a candy store called <a href=#>Samuel's Sweet Shop</a> with celebrity pal Paul Rudd and others.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbvOqZyrZpOkunB9km5qcm1oZMSpu4ypo5qxlZl6pbHNp7BmnKWmwqbA055koKqVrsBurc2aq6ilqWQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
