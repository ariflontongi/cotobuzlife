His mom later moved to Skaneateles, also in Onondaga County, and despite their separation, David's parents raised him together.</p><p id=er7dHM9qapUk data-wc=105>David previously opened up in an interview with <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Syracuse.com</a> about his parents, where said he remembered his mother and father driving him to the television studios where he was interning. "One of the images I won't forget is my mother and my father driving me there on summer vacation or school breaks," he said, adding: "When most kids go off to do other things, I remember just begging them to take me to that TV station. I'm sure they dreaded it. Between the two of them, they had to get me there.
