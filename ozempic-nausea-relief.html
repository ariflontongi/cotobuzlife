Nausea is one of the most common side effects, and when it’s severe, it can cause patients to skip doses or discontinue the medication altogether. The good news is there are a number of things you can do to reduce or better manage ozempic-induced nausea.</p><p>{{mid-cta}}</p><h2>Why Does Ozempic Cause Nausea?</h2><p>Ozempic (also known as semaglutide) is in a class of FDA-approved drugs called <a href=#>GLP-1 receptor agonists</a>, along with other common brand name drugs like Trulicity, Mounjaro, Saxenda, and Wegovy.&nbsp;</p><p>These drugs bind to and activate the GLP-1 receptor cells that are located in your pancreas and work to <a href=#>lower blood glucose</a> in the following ways:2</p><ul role=list><li>Trigger your pancreas to release more insulin when your blood sugar is high</li><li>Slow down digestion in the stomach (also called delayed gastric emptying)</li><li>Prevent your liver from producing and secreting glucose into the bloodstream</li></ul><p>Most glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) prescription medications like Ozempic are intended for use in people living with type 2 diabetes, but given their powerful weight loss effects, they are also prescribed for people who are overweight or obese.</p><p>While the exact reason why Ozempic causes nausea is still unknown, one theory is that it’s a result of the slowed digestion in your stomach. When food stays in your stomach longer than normal, it can cause feelings of fullness and queasiness. One study found that approximately 44% of patients taking Ozempic experienced nausea.3&nbsp;</p><h2>How Long Does Nausea From Ozempic Last?</h2><p>Many patients find that feelings of nausea are mild to moderate and diminish the longer they are on the drug. Although this side effect is usually temporary, it can still be very unpleasant and may be the reason people stop taking the drug. One study found that 7% of subjects discontinued treatment with Ozempic due to side effects like nausea.3</p><p>Higher doses have been associated with more severe nausea and other gastrointestinal side effects, so it’s a good idea to talk to your doctor to determine the right dose for you.4</p><p>&lt;p class="pro-tip">&lt;strong><strong>Also Read: </strong>&lt;/strong>&lt;a href="ozempic-foods-to-avoid">7 Foods to Avoid to Manage Ozempic Side Effects&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></p><h2>How to Combat Nausea From Ozempic</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/assets-global.website-files.com/63ed08484c069d0492f5b0bc/65a822b4092627d37df4c4ae_65a7e032f0e2d37283a8f777_cup-of-lemon-tean-with-ginger.webp><p>If you are taking Ozempic and are experiencing nausea, here are some things to try to help reduce this unwanted side effect.</p><h3>Change the Dose</h3><p>Studies suggest that Ozempic-related nausea is dose-dependent, meaning that lower doses tend to cause less nausea, and higher doses increase the risk of nausea.4 Talk to your healthcare provider about the right starting dose of Ozempic and dose escalation plan to prevent or best manage nausea.&nbsp;</p><h3>Watch What You’re Eating</h3><p>Diet plays a huge role in everyone’s health, but this is even more true in patients with type 2 diabetes. Ozempic is intended to be used in conjunction with a healthy diet and regular exercise in order to most effectively manage <a href=#>blood sugar</a>, so it’s not a free pass to eat whatever you want. Processed foods that are high in fat (fried foods, chips, ice cream, etc.) may not only keep your blood sugar high but may also increase the risk of nausea.</p><p>If you experience nausea, it’s best to avoid anything spicy and incorporate more simple bland foods into your diet. Focus on balanced meals and snacks that have vegetables, fruit, whole grain carbohydrates, and healthy sources of protein.</p><h3>Small Frequent Meals</h3><p>Although your appetite may be decreased when taking Ozempic, it’s important to make sure you’re still getting the necessary nutrients. If you’re experiencing nausea, eating smaller meals more often (as opposed to larger meals) can help. Remember to also drink plenty of water, as dehydration can result in dizziness and nausea.</p><h3>Ginger</h3><p>Along with its anti-inflammatory properties, ginger can also have anti-nausea effects. <a href=#>Ginger</a> contains phytonutrients called gingerols and shogaols that reduce nausea and vomiting by binding to 5-HT3 receptors in the body. Both fresh ginger and ginger supplements can be effective.5</p><h3>Aromatherapy</h3><p>Essential oils like peppermint have been shown to significantly relieve symptoms of nausea when inhaled. Peppermint oil can be combined with anti-nausea medication or used alone.6&nbsp;</p><h2>Other Ozempic-Related Side Effects</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/assets-global.website-files.com/63ed08484c069d0492f5b0bc/65a822b4092627d37df4c4a5_65a7e009682869380d923762_woman-sneazing.webp><p>In addition to nausea, below are some other <a href=#>possible side effects</a> of Ozempic.
