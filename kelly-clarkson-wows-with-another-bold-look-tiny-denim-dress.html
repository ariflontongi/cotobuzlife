What's more, she's put down the increased walking in the vast city as the reason behind her weight loss transformation.&nbsp;</p><p id=eQzXC-VzMC data-wc=34>She opened up about her health journey in a recent interview with People, crediting her weight loss, in part, to exploring the city with her children, River Rose, nine, and son Remington Alexander, seven.&nbsp;</p><p id=eRAuCA0H2U data-wc=46>The steps she walks in the walkable city gives her "quite the workout," but Kelly says she hasn't lost weight for appearance sake, but for her health. "I dropped weight because I've been listening to my doctor," she told the outlet. "A couple years I didn’t."&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/849634048814-kelly-clarkson-rockefeller.jpg><p id=e0jASwV4OO data-wc=57>This means not only adding more exercise to her regime but focusing on a healthy diet too. "I eat a healthy mix," said the star. "90 percent of the time I'm really good at it because a protein diet is good for me anyway. I'm a Texas girl, so I like meat. Sorry, vegetarians in the world!".&nbsp;</p><p id=e9tyPc4dHf data-wc=57>On her children settling into city life, Kelly spoke with Audacy backstage at its 10th annual We Can Survive at the beginning of October. "My son walked out of his school and was like, 'This is the right school for me. The other one didn’t fit like this one,'" she said of Remy embracing his new school.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/d388709ff1ba-gettyimages-1447288777.jpg><p id=ezQmRn0W4z data-wc=40>With the relocation, family remains at the forefront of her decisions. Situated close to the iconic 30 Rockefeller Plaza, her show's new location, Kelly, 41, emphasized to USA Today: "At this point, I'm 40 years old. Mama rented something nice!"&nbsp;</p><p id=esxp3QGYN7 data-wc=33>She added: "I was like, 'I’m not living here unless it’s right by the park and really nice for the kids,'" she added, emphasizing the significance of a comfortable life for her children.</p><p id=eK3ODECidO data-wc=6>Read more <a class=hm-link href=#>HELLO!
