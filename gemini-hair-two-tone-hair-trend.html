As for the name? If you’re familiar with astrology, then you know that this nickname stems from the Gemini sign's representation of twins. The twins stand for the dual-naturedness of those born under a Gemini sun, hence the name of this dual-sided hair color."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

How boring would it be to scroll your feeds endlessly without seeing something new and creative like Gemini hair? This attention-grabbing two-toned hair trend is sure to grab the attention of For You page viewers.</p><p>Ahead, Santo breaks down everything you should know about Gemini hair, especially if you want to try it yourself.</p><h4 class="ConsentBannerTitle-lgaGAH gOfech">Instagram content</h4><p>This content can also be viewed on the site it <a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer" aria-label="Opens in a new window" class="BaseWrap-sc-gjQpdd BaseText-ewhhUZ BaseLink-eNWuiM ConsentBannerLink-dJZMSz iUEiRd irjujW csfskF">originates</a> from.</p><p>All products featured on Glamour are independently selected by our editors.

Photos are a great way to communicate to your stylist exactly what you want, especially because things can get lost in translation with just words.&nbsp;</p><p>“Your ashy is not my ashy,” explains Santo, a hair color might seem cool-toned to the untrained eye, but to a professional colorist, the hair color in question may still have some warmth to it. To take that to the next level and make sure there is absolutely no misinterpretation, Santo recommends bringing images of what you don't want too. That way, the colorist knows what not to give you.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLjApqauql6YvK570q2mq7FfnLKutc2iZKGZmad6tcPOZquoppVitaK10Warq52emQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
