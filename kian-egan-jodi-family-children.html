Speaking about his beautiful family, Kian said: "Being away from my family made me look at our lives. I was on top of the world and the only other time I'd felt like this was when we had Koa. I'd love to have a mini Jodi. I'm so lucky to have her and Koa and if we can give him a brother or sister, why wait?" Chatting about his time on I'm a Celeb, he added: "It taught me to take nothing for granted. Just to be able to walk past a shop and buy a bar of chocolate feels fantastic to me now. When you're stripped of all the resources we have at our fingertips and forced to live on a small portion of rice and beans each day it changes your outlook, makes you think."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/b31a827c4018-big-stars-kian-egan-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=eiIxg9FvNBA_ data-wc=6><strong>Kian and Jodi share three children</strong></p><p id=eZ1cqjjpX3O3 data-wc=1><strong>READ: <a class=hm-link href=#>Westlife's Kian Egan shares cute first picture of newborn son: 'Our little Cobi cub'</a></strong></p><p id=epchxj2bBuTT data-wc=41>Other stars appearing on the show include Samia Longchambon and her daughter Freya, and Bridget Jones actress Sally Phillips with her son, Tom.
