Unfortunately for Cooke, the camera was directly behind her when her wardrobe malfunction occurred, giving <a href=#>those watching</a> a full view of her behind.</p><p dir=ltr>Cooke didn't seem too embarrassed, however, and even found something positive in splitting her pants. She told <a href=#>The Sun</a>, "It's a good way to break the ice, especially with new team-mates — it always gets a laugh." The racer did point out though, "I'm just so grateful I was wearing underwear that day." Cooke seemed to be sporting a black thong, a reasonable choice to wear under those super-tight racing suits that would probably cling to any other kind of undergarments. With a fitted wardrobe like that needed for racing, it's no surprise that one false move would cause a rip.</p><p dir=ltr>While Cooke said having her butt exposed was "Bloody freezing," she knew she couldn't let it stop her, or her team would be disqualified. "I blocked it out until I got in the sleigh and sat down, when I was suddenly reminded it was mighty cold," she recalled. Since then, the clip of her wardrobe malfunction reached over a million views on YouTube, with Cooke noting, "It's fair to say my glute is more famous than my face."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamlgboJxe86lsKaomZh6qK3MnqpmpZ%2BowW6t1qSumqqUYsSivsOrppudXaKurbLUp5qtoZ%2BjwHA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
