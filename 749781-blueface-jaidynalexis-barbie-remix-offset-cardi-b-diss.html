Her man and MILF Music label founder, Blueface, had a huge hand in the song's success. The Cali native had writing credits and it is a big reason why so many are vibing with it. Jaidyn and Blueface are back for more, with a remix.</p><p>However, this is not just a new version with a full verse from the "Thotiana" hitmaker. He is sending shots right at <a href=# class=text-word rel>Offset</a>, <a href=# class=text-word rel>Cardi B</a>, and <a href=# class=text-word rel>Soulja Boy</a>. He raps, "Offset upset Cardi got the update / Soulja Boy mad he found out his b**** f****d late." Of course, the first part of those lyrics is a reference to the time Blueface revealed that the <a href=# rel>Migos member hooked up with Chrisean Rock.</a></p><p><strong>Read More: <a href=# rel>Kanye West Flaunts Bianca Censori In Her Underwear, Promises "No Pants" In 2024</a></strong></p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-listen-to-barbie-remix-by-jaidynalexis-and-blueface>Listen To "Barbie Remix" By JaidynAlexis And Blueface</h2></span><p>In terms of the Soulja Boy part, that is a diss toward the ongoing beef between them. That all began when Blueface said he could take on the "Crank That" hitmaker in a Verzuz battle. However, he took it a step further by saying that he <a href=# rel>messed around with Soulja's current baby mama</a> before they got together. Needless to say, this is going to cause a stir online. It will be interesting to see how all three of these names respond to Blue in the following days.</p><p>What are your initial thoughts on this brand-new version of "Barbie" by Jaidyn Alexis and Blueface? Is the remix better than the original, why or why not? Do you think Offset, Cardi B, or Soulja Boy will respond to the shots by Blueface? Where does this rank among disses in a rap song?
