Glaser launched her own namesake podcast, "The Nikki Glaser Podcast," in March 2021, where she discusses "the latest in pop culture, news, entertainment and life," with co-host Andrew Collin, per&nbsp;<a href=# one-link-mark=yes>iHeart Radio</a>. The podcast was launched under Will Ferrell's Big Money Players Network, which is appropriate because Glaser has become a "big money player" in her own right.</p><p dir=ltr><a href=# one-link-mark=yes>Celebrity Net Worth</a> reports that Glaser has a net worth of approximately $2 million. She landed her first big break after Comedy Central hired her for her own series, "Not Safe with Nikki Glaser" in 2016. The show ran for one season before it got canceled, according to <a href=# one-link-mark=yes>TV Line</a>. But the cancellation gave Glaser the opportunity to work with Netflix as she produced her own stand-up show called, "Bangin'" in 2019. Netflix, according to <a href=# one-link-mark=yes>Business Insider</a>, pays a lucrative amount to comedians for their specials, so Glaser would've received a hefty paycheck.&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr>Glaser credited her determination for pulling off "Bangin'," telling <a href=# one-link-mark=yes>Forbes</a> that comedians who don't self-edit and meticulously oversee their work aren't "going to be successful." She added, "you should do everything you can to make everything you do as great as possible.&nbsp;I knew that I could hand the reins over to someone else ... it wasn't going to be as good as it could be."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbWlgbn95e8eormalpZi1brXSZqWio5ueeqi4wKycq2WRmMG2rculsGavn6fBqXs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
