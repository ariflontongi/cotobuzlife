In 1995, less than halfway through the sentence, Tyson was released. Per <a href=#>Distractify</a>, Tyson claims that the commutation was his doing. At least at the time, parole in Indiana required one to pass the GED. After failing to pass it, Tyson chose to bypass it altogether by becoming intimate with the woman acting as his counselor.&nbsp;</p><p>Sexual and financial appeals to get into her good graces apparently led her to give him a passing score (via <a href=#>GiveMeSport</a>). It was not long after that he was released on parole, and while he did have to register as a sex offender, Tyson was able to return to boxing with relatively minimal difficulty. Despite all this and his 1997 biting of Evander Holyfield's ear during a bout, Tyson has since been on what many have described as a surprisingly successful redemption arc (via <a href=#>CNN</a>).</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunCClmppb29fqbWmedOrrK2gXZavsMHTZqSio5Viwbq%2FzqeqZqyZorJutc1moZqhnGQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
