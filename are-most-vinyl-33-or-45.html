This is the paradox of the vinyl record's set size.

A better way to group these discs and tell them apart is the speed (in revolutions per minute, or RPM) at which they spin while playing on a turntable.<h2>Why are some records 33 and some 45?</h2>One, in particular, has to do with three numbers: 33, 45, and 78. These numbers refer to the rate at which the record spins on the record player, measured in revolutions per minute (rpm). Most high-quality lp players & record players will come equipped to turn at these three standard speeds.<h2>What speed are most vinyl records?</h2>Speed and Diameter<p>Vinyl records come in three speeds: 33 1/3 rpm (often just called a “33”), 45 rpm and 78 rpm. The “rpm” is an abbreviation for “revolutions per minute” — an indication of how fast the record is meant to spin on the turntable.</p><h2>What size record is a 45?</h2>Shellac Records vs Vinyl Records Performance<p>The size is the most notable difference in the performance of 78 shellac records and 33 or 45 vinyl records. The 45s are typically 7 inches, but 78s and 33s can be either 10 or 12 inches.</p><h2>Vinyl Record Sizes and Speeds | What does 33 – 45 - 78 RPM mean?</h2><p></p><h2>Do they still make 45 records?</h2>In the 1990s, most record labels discontinued production of the 45 RPM vinyl record. As a result, the 45 quickly become a collectors item.<h2>What are old 45s worth?</h2>Rock and roll and R&B 45s with picture sleeves that were pressed in the 1950's have a value of at least $10, with many being valued at more than $100. EPs were only made in the 50's and 60's. Rock and roll and R&B 45s with the cardboard sleeves are worth at least $20, with many being worth more than $200.<h2>What is the rarest 45 record?</h2>There are only two known copies of Do I Love You (Indeed I Do), a rare 45-rpm Northern soul track by Frank Wilson, one of which sold for $37,000 in 2009.<h2>When did 33 records come out?</h2>In 1948, the 33 1/3 RPM record was produced by Columbia Records, which was produced in a long play (LP) record playing for about 20 minutes each side. The record material was made thicker and used a different vinyl material which reduced noise.<h2>What size is a 33 album?</h2>The LP (from "long playing" or "long play") is an analog sound storage medium, a phonograph record format characterized by: a speed of 331⁄3 rpm; a 12- or 10-inch (30- or 25-cm) diameter; use of the "microgroove" groove specification; and a vinyl (a copolymer of vinyl chloride acetate) composition disk.<h2>Are small records 45?</h2>Single discs are physically smaller – usually 7 inch 45 RPM releases. If you purchased the full length, 12-inch album, you have an LP.<h2>What is normal vinyl size?</h2>Standard Sizes<p>Vinyl record sizes differ based on how much music is stored on the surface of the disk. Records come in three standard sizes: 7-inch, 10-inch, and 12-inch.</p><h2>Why is red Taylors Version vinyl 45?</h2>For one, most 12-inch LPs play at 33 1/3 rpm. When pressed to be played at 45 rpm, a record holds less music per side, so pressing Red (Taylor's Version) at 45 rpm might have helped stretch the 30-song set out across four vinyl discs.<h2>Is CD better quality than vinyl?</h2>Sound Quality<p>From a technical standpoint, digital CD audio quality is clearly superior to vinyl. CDs have a better signal-to-noise ratio (i.e. there is less interference from hissing, turntable rumble, etc.), better stereo channel separation, and have no variation in playback speed.</p><h2>Why do records play at 33 RPM?</h2>In 1931, RCA Victor introduced the 33 1/3 format, in an attempt to boost record sales that had been dropping since the stock market crash two years previously, but the lack of turntables that spun at 33 1/3 r.p.m., combined with the poor quality of the records in general, doomed the project to failure.<h2>How do you tell what size a vinyl is?</h2><p>Understanding the Vinyl Record Size Chart</p><li>12-inch: Twelve inches is the standard diameter for full albums, generally holding up to 22 minutes per side. ...</li><li>7-inch: While not as common as 12-inch records, 7-inch presses feature one or two songs per side and run at 45 RPM.</li><h2>What speed is Taylor Swift vinyl?</h2>Play at 45rpm for optimal sound quality. Limit 4 per customer.<h2>What is the difference between a 45 and an LP?</h2>Generally cut at 45 RPM, they feature wider groove spacing and shorter playing time compared to LPs, which permits a broader dynamic range or louder recording level (among other benefits.<h2>How many songs are on a 45 record?</h2>45s or the 7-inch 45 RPM vinyl record.<p>With about four and a half minutes on each side, you can expect about two songs to fit on a 7-inch vinyl cut at 45 RPM. 45s are considered singles because a single track fits without compromising the sound quality.</p><h2>What is the 45 record adapter called?</h2>A 45 rpm adapter (also 45 rpm record insert, 45 rpm spindle adapter, 7-inch adapter or spider, the common size of 45 RPM records) is a small plastic or metal insert that goes in the middle of a 45-rpm record so it can be played on the standard size spindle of a turntable.<h2>What year did 45 records come out?</h2>While this may sound clunky or cumbersome, vinyl 45s commercially introduced in 1949 by Camden's RCA Victor revolutionized the music industry. They sounded better than shellac 78s, lasted longer and tended not to shatter if dropped.<h2>Can Victrola play 45s?</h2>Includes built-in Bluetooth technology to wirelessly stream music from any Bluetooth enabled device, 3-speed turntable (33 1/3, 45, 78 RPM), built-in speakers, 3.5mm aux-in jack for playing music from any non-Bluetooth device, RCA jack and headphone jack.<h2>Is LP the same as vinyl?</h2>So, is vinyl and LP the same? LP means Long Play which refers to a full-length record. Vinyl is a word used now interchangeably with record or album. LP technically refers to the length of a record which can be between 10-12 songs.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrTnqmvoZWsrrOxwGeaqKVfm66ye8CrnGaln6jBbsLIp7ClZWNoerC%2BjG1s</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
