"I don’t think no one’s friend," Coi explained, "I think, at the end of the day, it is a competition here, not everybody can be number one. But at the same time, it should be friendly competition.

During an interview with Eddie Francis for Apple Music 1, she opened up about dealing with body shaming. The "Players" rapper explained that her own confidence works towards <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">generating acceptance</a> for other thin women in the industry. "I’ve dealt with the body shaming situation, honestly my whole entire career," Coi revealed. "Shout out to all the slim women out there. I feel like I actually paved the way in the music industry for a slim woman to just finally be accepted, honestly, after a very long time."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">The artist also previously expressed her discomfort when Latto called her out on "Put It On Da Floor," claiming that she didn't want her body to be a part of the narrative. “So if we’re going to say we’re going to stop talking about bodies, then <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">don’t mention anything about my body,</a>” she explained. “Just period. Don’t compare me to nothing, don’t think about nothing."</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Caroline Fisher is a News Writer at HotNewHipHop from Chicago, Illinois.
