He explains that his imposing physical appearance, with a robust physique, earned him respect when people saw him on the streets. This led to an offer that greatly excited him.</p><h2 class=ue-c-article__subheadline>Why didn't Murder Clown work with Shakira?</h2><p>In 1992, <strong>Murder Clown </strong>made the decision to pursue wrestling as his profession and began training at Shu El Guerrero's gym. It was around this time that he received an offer from AAA (Lucha Libre AAA Worldwide), prompting him to bid farewell to his career in private security.</p><p>"I worked as security, because of my big body, I was 16 years old, and I couldn't do much for work," said <strong>Murder Clown </strong>in an interview for the podcast 'Sin Mascaras', the wrestling program of mediotiempo.com.</p><p>"At that time I worked in a company called Acero which was taking care of artists, and I remember a lot that my brother and I were always big and they sent us to the best places with artists.</p><p>"There was a <strong>Shakira </strong>tour and they told me that I would go on tour with her. I was excited, knowing that I was going to see her, but when they asked me for my passport and my INE, and when they found out that I was 16 years old, they said that it was not possible. I was a minor, and it was my job to start with, but my brother paid for my classes, my dad and my mom always supported me, I was always well supported".</p><p>The paths of <strong>Murder Clown and Shakira </strong>were destined to remain separate. While <strong>Shakira </strong>has become one of the world's biggest music stars, <strong>Murder Clown </strong>has made a name for himself as a prominent figure in the world of wrestling.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3RnJhnm5%2BifKa6jqWgn52jqcatsY6cnKWdkqe2tbXErGZraGJofHGCjmpsaG5kba6mgsScaWtuYGaxeq%2BVa2%2BbbGWahG%2B006aj</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
