By 2018, however, the comedian was much more vulnerable and candid about his role in their relationship ending and his wrongdoings. Per&nbsp;<a href=#>Us Weekly</a>, in his Netflix special "Chris Rock: Tamborine," he took responsibility for his marriage crumbling, telling the crowd, "It's my fault because I'm a f***ing a*****e."</p><p dir=ltr>Rock also noted that infidelity changes the existing relationship in ways that are hard to come back from."When guys cheat, it's like we want something new. But then you know what happens? Your woman finds out and now she's new. She is never the same again," he said. "So now you have new, but you had a bad new."</p><p dir=ltr><a href=#>Rolling Stone</a> reported in Rock's 2017 cover story that in a show at&nbsp;New York City's Comedy Cellar, the&nbsp;comedian mentioned having affairs with three different women. Though the identities of the women have not been confirmed, there's been plenty of speculation about who he cheated with.&nbsp;<a href=#>Page Six</a>, for example, reported that a source claimed he had a fling with fellow "I Think I Love My Wife" costar Kerry Washington, but again, it's all hearsay, and neither party has commented on the rumor.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmcWxgZX56e9OhnGasoqrBqXnAm6aurF2YtbO10mapqJubqHqnrcilnJ1lnZa%2Fs7XAoJxo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
