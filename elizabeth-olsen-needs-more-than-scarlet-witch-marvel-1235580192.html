I so much want to do films right now. And I hope some of them come together in the way I feel like they can. But yeah, that’s something that I need. I just need more, other characters in my life. There’s no longevity in one character.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Prior to joining the MCU, she felt she had found a “sweet spot” in the roles that she would accept. A couple films she is “very proud” of from that time are Wind River and<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#> Ingrid Goes West</a>.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“They were so different and you can’t compare them,” Olsen said. “So, I just want more of that in my life just because I get satisfaction from the variation.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Elsewhere in the profile, the actress opened up about not maintaining a very public life outside of her work, explaining that she doesn’t want to be seen as a celebrity, just an actor. She also shared she hopes to start a family with her husband, Robbie Arnett. If they have children, however, Olsen said she wouldn’t allow them to work in Hollywood before they turn 18.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“Hard no. My sisters are unique so it’s not a reflection on them when I say no, I think it’s a reflection more on culture today,” she said. “Being younger today is already so complicated. To amplify it by being a child actor and then amplify it by social media, I just think it’s a lot for a kid’s development.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue8yoraKdo2S6sMLInmSnnaeofKa4yLOYm52knXqwuNKepWamlZqxtHnMqKmeZaSdrq950pyYq6SVqXq4tdOcn2alkafDpriMamlsbWVtfXKFkWg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
