"I and Mr. Steven Jordan were involved in a long-term romantic relationship," the affidavit read. "We engaged in sexual intercourse with each other in the month of April 2016. As a result of the intercourse, I conceived a child with Mr. Jordan."</p><p dir=ltr>Why would they lie about being married, though? Apparently, Stevie agreed to lie out of love. In 2016, on Season 5 of "Love & Hip Hop: Atlanta," Stevie admitted that he went along with the lie to make his partner happy. According to him, Joseline really wanted to be married so, instead of actually tying the knot, he agreed to lie for five years so that he could please her. "I thought it was a forever thing," he said (via <a href=#>IBT</a>).&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbWxpaH55e9OhnGaqlZa5br7Emqqopl2fvLSxy6KlnmWYmr%2Bvrc2dnLNlkaOxbr%2FTnq2inV2feqetyp6bZqyYmrazecyaqauhkZyycA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
