"And I think about the moments I did have to kind of say, 'Well, look, I’m going to be myself and I have curves and this is who I am.'"</p><p>Winslet went on to explain how toxic the industry was back then, and how young women have helped shift the standards. "There was a lot of kind of fat-shaming that would go on back in the day, and that. Has. Changed," she said. "And it's changed because young women now, they're born with a voice."</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Kate Winslet sits down with @hodakotb to talk about her role as a paranoid chancellor in a new HBO series from the creators of “Succession” called “The Regime,” her work of championing other women in the entertainment industry and more. pic.twitter.com/BbKQOGksG5<a href=# data-url=https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1762122378383892961 referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>February 26, 2024</a></p><p>Back in September, Winslet expressed a similar sentiment when she was promoting the movie Lee, in which she had to film a topless scene.</p><p>"You know I had to be really f**king brave about letting my body be its softest version of itself and not hiding from that," <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/celebrity/kate-winslet-topless-scene/>she told&nbsp;Vogue at the time</a>.</p><p>Winslet added about how bad things were when she first started, "They would comment on my size, they’d estimate what I weighed, they’d print the supposed diet I was on. It was critical and horrible and so upsetting to read. But it also made me feel so…so moved. By how different it is now."
