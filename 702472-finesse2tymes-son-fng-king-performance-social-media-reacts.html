The embattled artist has given us a handful of viral tracks. Still, listeners are having a hard time overlooking the way he chooses to live his life. Not only is the rapper in a polyamorous relationship with several women (which he regularly shows off in <a href=# rel>salacious photos</a> online), but he also has unconventional parenting methods that have left many worried about the wellbeing of his 10-year-old son, FNG King.</p><p>In a video circulating on various blogs today (August 11), Finesse is seen performing with his little one. The child confidently yells out troubling lyrics about disregarding consent during sex. "Take this d**k, b**ch, stop pushing me," the duo repeatedly yells out as the crowd cheers them on. While those in attendance seemed to be feeling the father-son bonding moment, many internet users are less than impressed. "That's completely inappropriate to be telling that child to do that and he rapping that mess at the same time smh," one person vented on Twitter.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <strong><a href=# rel>Finesse2tymes‚Äô Girlfriend, FNG Shugga, Gets His Face Tattooed: Video</a></strong></p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-finesse2tymes-performs-with-his-10-year-old-son>Finesse2tymes Performs with His 10-Year-Old Son</h2></span><p>"Kids have to be protected and exposing them to certain things at this age is so negligent. And honestly predatory," another upset user wrote. "It‚Äôs 'mind your own business' when it comes to this but let a child say that they‚Äôre LGBT, they should wait until they‚Äôre 18 to decide. Okay," someone else chimed in, seemingly referencing the debate sparked by <a href=# class=text-word rel>Ne-Yo</a>'s thoughts on <a href=# rel>transgender children</a> earlier this month.</p><p>On the other hand, there are those who believe Finesse is doing right by keeping his son out of the streets. "Enjoying life instead of having to worry bout some bs going on stray bullets, wrong crowds, all stuff that go on in the hood. Some people keep they kids off the streets in different ways while y‚Äôall need to get y‚Äôall!üó£Ô∏è," one such person expressed.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <strong><a href=# rel>Ne-Yo Continues Trans Discourse With Another Statement: ‚ÄúI WILL NOT BE BULLIED INTO APOLOGIZING‚Äù</a></strong></p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Social Media Reacts</h2></span><p>Keep scrolling to read more of the reactions to Finesse2tymes' recent performance with his son.
