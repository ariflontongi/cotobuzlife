A movie sounded awesome, but I’ve never done commercials, and it just didn’t feel like my bag," she said. "Also ... I didn’t know that everyone was doing it. I would, of course, always love to be part of a&nbsp;Mean Girls&nbsp;reunion and hang with my Plastics, but yeah, I found that out later.”</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Unique Nicole/GA/The Hollywood Reporter via Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">McAdams also spoke about rumors that she'd have a cameo in the upcoming&nbsp;Mean Girls&nbsp;movie musical, which is an on-screen adaptation of the Broadway show. Tina Fey and Tim Meadows are reprising their roles, however, and McAdams said that although she was in talks with Fey, things didn't work out. But even after all of that, the OG Regina George is still excited to see the film.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Tina and I sort of dabbled with a few ideas, but it was tough to make it all work in the end,” she finished. “I was really down for whatever she wanted to do. I think the direction it went in will be fantastic and I cannot wait to see it.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK570ZqaoZ2cYrqkrcOapKxlp5bAr8CMoqVmpZWWu26zyKujrGWimsKvtc6nZJynnaKys6%2FImqNmr5iuenmAkHFwbHE%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
