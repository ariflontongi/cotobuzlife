Church President Joseph Fielding Smith wrote the dedicatory prayer, which was read by President Harold B. Lee, first counselor in the First Presidency.
President Smith presided over the ceremony. In his opening remarks, he shared that the dedication fell on the 172nd anniversary of the birth of his grandfather, Hyrum Smith. President Joseph Fielding Smith shared how grateful he was for the restored Church in these latter days: “I am pleased that we are celebrating [Hyrum Smith’s birthday] by presenting to the Lord another holy temple, wherein those keys and powers, held jointly by him and the Prophet Joseph Smith, may be used for the salvation and exaltation of many of our Father’s children."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Brown</a> and <a class=link href=# data-cms-ai=0>President N. Eldon Tanner</a> of the First Presidency on Aug. 14, 1967. Ground was broken on Sept. 15, 1969, and once construction was completed, an open house was held from Jan. 8 to Jan. 29, 1972.</p><p><a class=link href=# data-cms-ai=0>President Joseph Fielding Smith</a> dedicated the temple on Feb. 9, 1972, and <a class=link href=# data-cms-ai=0>President Harold B. Lee</a>, first counselor in the First Presidency, read the dedicatory prayer.</p><p><a class=link href=# data-cms-ai=0>President Russell M. Nelson</a> announced on Oct. 3, 2021, that the Provo Utah Temple would be reconstructed, with construction starting Feb. 24, 2024, a month after the dedication of the <a class=link href=# data-cms-ai=0>Orem Utah Temple</a>.</p><h2>Original Architecture and Design of the Provo Utah Temple</h2><p>The Provo Utah Temple covers an area of 130,825 square feet and sits on a 17-acre site. It rises 175 feet high with a 118-foot spire above the center of the building. The temple has a flat, round base with a spire in the center, made to represent <a class=link href=# data-cms-ai=0>Exodus 13:21</a> as the Lord went before the children of Israel “by day in a pillar of a cloud, to lead them the way; and by night in a pillar of fire, to give them light.”</p><p>The exterior is lined with white cast stone, gold anodized aluminum grills and bronze glass panels. The center spire was originally finished in gold and anodized aluminum. In May 2003, the spire was painted white when a statue of the angel Moroni was placed upon it.</p><p>Inside the house of the Lord are six ordinance rooms to allow a new session to start every 20 minutes. The temple also has a baptistry, a celestial room and 12 sealing rooms. The design uses four floors, including a below-ground floor with the baptistry. The celestial room sits in the center of the top floor, with the ordinance rooms surrounding it.</p><p>The top two floors have a corridor circling around the entire building, whose inspiration came from a park surrounded by an elliptical roadway in Copenhagen, <a class=link href=# data-cms-ai=0>Denmark</a>. This design provides an easier flow of patrons and makes it almost impossible to get lost.</p><h2>Renovated Architecture and Design of the Provo Utah Temple</h2><p>During <a class=link href=# data-cms-ai=0>October 2021 general conference</a>, <a class=link href=# data-cms-ai=0>President Russell M. Nelson</a> announced that the Provo Utah Temple would be reconstructed. <a class=link href=# data-cms-ai=0>A rendering of this reconstruction</a> was released the month after, on Nov. 24, 2021.</p><p>Plans call for a building with long, arched windows on the front facade, as well as three white arches in front of the entrance. A multilevel tower with a rectangular base and golden spire will sit above the center of the building.</p><p>Reconstruction of the Provo Utah Temple will begin on Feb. 24, 2024, the month after the <a class=link href=# data-cms-ai=0><u>Orem Utah Temple</u></a> is dedicated and more than 50 years after the Provo Utah Temple’s first dedication.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/deseret.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/57d3b06/2147483647/strip/true/crop/610x361+0+128/resize/125x74!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-deseret.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fa2%2F66%2Fe5a88a9249ff91a86bd70f594c73%2Fpresident-hugh-b.-Brown-and-President-N.-Eldon-Tanner.jpeg"><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEnJ%2BuqpOdu6bD0meaqKVflrmurc2ammislaK9rbHSaKerp6akerbAwKE%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
