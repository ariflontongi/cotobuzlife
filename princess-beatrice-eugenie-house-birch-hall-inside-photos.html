It's a proper country house with five acres of grounds. The house itself is a very attractive and imposing-looking property. Some of the rooms are really quite dramatic, with high ceilings and full floor to ceiling sash windows. It's got a swimming pool, tennis court and beautiful specimen trees dating from Victorian times in the garden."</p><p id=e4VV0G8Y63wo data-wc=59>Speaking of its heritage, Andrew added, "The owners bought it from the trustees acting for the Queen in 1999. The trustees bought it in 1997 for the princesses and I imagine it was chosen because it's a pretty house in a popular village and the gardens are a real draw, it's more like parkland. But they never moved in."</p><p id=eAoyakVSOYuA data-wc=30>He also explained how its owners had renovated the house: "They reconfigured the staircase and updated the house throughout, moving the kitchen so it overlooks the garden and swimming pool."</p><p id=e5AdO0SdCw8p data-wc=23></p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
