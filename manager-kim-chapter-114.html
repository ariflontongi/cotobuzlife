They encountered many enemies and traps along the way, but they managed to overcome them with their skills and teamwork. Kim also learned more about the organization’s leader, who was his former colleague and friend, Lee. Lee was the one who betrayed Kim and joined the organization, which was conducting experiments on humans and enhancing their abilities with nanotechnology. Lee was also the one who kidnapped Minji and used her as a test subject for his experiments. Kim was determined to find and confront Lee, and rescue his daughter.</p><p>Meanwhile, Minji was still unconscious and hooked to a machine that was monitoring her vital signs and brain activity. She was having a nightmare, in which she relived the moments of her abduction and torture. She saw Lee’s face and heard his voice, telling her that he was going to make her into a weapon for his plans. She felt a surge of pain and fear, and she screamed for her father to save her. However, no one heard her, and she was left alone in the dark.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Where_To_Read></span><strong>Where To Read</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>You can read the official Korean version of Manager Kim Chapter 114 on Naver Webtoon, which is the original platform that publishes the webtoon.
