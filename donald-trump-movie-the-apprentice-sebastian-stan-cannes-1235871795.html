The film is described as a mentor-protégé narrative that documents the start of an American dynasty and tackles themes including power, corruption and deception. It delves into the relationship between Trump and Roy Cohn, the New York City prosecutor oft-remembered for working with Sen.&nbsp;Joseph McCarthy&nbsp;during the&nbsp;Second Red Scare.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The movie’s official logline reads: “The Apprentice is a dive into the underbelly of the American empire. It charts a young Donald Trump’s ascent to power through a Faustian deal with the influential right-wing lawyer and political fixer Roy Cohn.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Adding to the film’s must-watch buzziness, Succession star Jeremy Strong&nbsp;appears opposite Stan in the co-starring role of&nbsp;Cohn.
