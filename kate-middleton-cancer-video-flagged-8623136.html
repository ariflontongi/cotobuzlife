It was the first time that she addressed the public and shared her cancer treatment. A spokesperson for the Cambridges noted that Kate "wanted to share this information when she and the prince felt it was right for them as a family."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Max Mumby/Indigo/Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"In January, I underwent major abdominal surgery in London, and at the time, it was thought that my condition was non-cancerous," Kate explained in the video. "The surgery was successful. However, tests after the operation found cancer had been present. My medical team, therefore, advised that I should undergo a course of preventative chemotherapy, and I am now in the early stages of that treatment."<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Getty Images's note comes after Kate's Mother's Day post was pulled from news agencies after allegations of photo manipulation. The Associated Press and Agence France-Presse removed the image from their coverage of Kate's post.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Phil Chetwynd, AFP's news director, told E! that the palace's press materials come with a bit of skepticism after the incident.
