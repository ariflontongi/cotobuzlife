However, it was added that he will be returning to the VP role he once had and not as an in-ring talent.</p><p>”Fightful has learned that QT Marshall is returning to All Elite Wrestling, but in a much different capacity. Sources indicated to Fightful that Marshall and AEW worked out their prior issues, and he’ll be coming back in the VP role that he once held. However, he is not planned to return as an in-ring talent.”</p><p>”Those that we spoke to say that an agreement was in place as of a couple of weeks ago. He has not started back with the company as of yet. We’re told that Marshall is free to wrestle outside of AEW, with the exception of WWE. The 38-year old Marshall hasn’t wrestled since his AEW deal officially ended on December 31, but has shown off his physical transformation on Twitter.”</p><p>We will have to wait and see when QT Marshall will return to AEW, as Tony Khan will certainly be happy to have someone like Marshall back in the fold, especially considering how AEW is changing things up again this year.</p><p>What do you think of this story concerning QT Marshall?
