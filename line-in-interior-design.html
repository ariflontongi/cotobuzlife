The tide line can be tonal or contrasting colors, both create a very graphic quality adding real interest to the room.’</p><p>In the image below from <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# rel="sponsored noopener" data-url="https://www.originalbtc.com/?country=null&cclcl=null" referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=skimlinks data-placeholder-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1623321&xcust=hawk-custom-tracking&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.originalbtc.com%2F%3Fcountry%3Dnull%26cclcl%3Dnull&sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.homesandgardens.com%2Fnews%2Fline-in-interior-design" data-google-interstitial=false data-merchant-name="SkimLinks - originalbtc.com" data-merchant-id=undefined data-merchant-url=undefined data-merchant-network=undefined>Original BTC</a>, lines are cleverly used to create zones; the slimline, short tongue and groove above the worktop adds a pop of color as well as a coziness that defines the work space. The vertical cladding lines are then widened and lengthened to create height.&nbsp;</p><p>Panelling on the cabinets helps to define the storage area, while fluted glass on the island does the same job but injects a different aesthetic as a contrast.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Xt89TqJdT2f7bC5cu43yPY-1920-80.jpg><p>See: <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.homesandgardens.com/kitchen-ideas><strong>Kitchen ideas</strong></a><strong> </strong>– decor and decorating ideas for all kitchens&nbsp;</p><p>Lines can also be used to add texture to a kitchen, through pattern on tiled splashbacks or fluting on cabinetry or glass, for example.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kHRbJ44PUVz4bnrtMm44y3-1920-80.jpg><h2 id=2-create-a-spa-style-bathroom-with-lines-2>2.

The curve of the freestanding bath above softens the vertical lines in the wall cladding, too.</p><p>Barrie says: 'You can also use lines to make a space feel bigger or small. An example is the use of tiles. If you have a long or narrow space, running tile lengthwise can make it feel bigger because the lines diminish into perspective. If you place the tiles running side to side, the room will look shorter but feel wider.'</p><p>As is the same in any room, lines can also be harnessed to inject texture into a bathroom, from fluted lights, cabinets and vanity units, to rustic wooden wall cladding.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/miNGnyU2HkbL4bePrVipEM-1920-80.jpg><p>See:<strong> </strong><a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.homesandgardens.com/spaces/decorating/bathroom-ideas-224312><strong>Bathroom ideas</strong></a><strong> </strong>– stylish decor ideas for all bathrooms</p><p>The beautiful wood cladding in the bathroom below, belonging to Bee Osborn, of <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# rel=nofollow data-url=https://osborninteriors.com/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Osborn Interiors</a>, shows how the ceiling cladding gives the room length and, as there's already height but not much width, horizontal wall cladding makes it feel bigger, as well as adding warmth with the grainy texture.</p><p>Tiffany Leigh says: 'The direction we run hardwood in a room is carefully planned when thinking about line and what it will do to a space.

Horizontal stripes make the walls and the room appear wider. Especially at one or two third intervals up a wall, they create the feeling of a larger space whilst also being directional, and, crucially, easier to paint than vertical lines!'</p><p>Annie adds: 'It’s a great way to incorporate more color into your home when you can’t decide on a wall color or if you’d like to experiment with a statement shade without committing to a whole wall of color. Using contrasting colors will make a grand statement; use the brighter color at the top third of the wall to draw the eye upwards and create the illusion of height as well as width! Use tonal colors for a more subtle, contemporary nod to the trend.'</p><p>Painted panelling is also a stylish way to use line to create a timeless and elevated feel in the bedroom.&nbsp;</p><p>See:<strong> </strong><a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.homesandgardens.com/spaces/decorating/bedroom-ideas-223507><strong>Bedroom ideas</strong></a><strong> </strong>– designs and inspiration for beautiful bedrooms</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/x4sEgy3X7GngAHGtfL8hwW-1920-80.jpg><p>The bedroom above by <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# rel=nofollow data-url=https://www.neptune.com/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Neptune</a> perfectly shows how using different lines can guide your eye around the room; the rug stripes run parallel with the wooden flooring, leading the eye to the back of the room, where vertical panelling draws the eye upwards to appreciate the artwork.

The lines in the rug add depth, color and dynamism to the room, while the round table softens the statement.
