His sister, <strong>Paris Jackson</strong>, arrived a year later. When the couple divorced in 1999, Rowe handed over custody of Prince and Paris to Jackson. An anonymous surrogate mother gave birth to the kids’ younger brother, <strong>Prince Michael II </strong>(or “Blanket”), in February 2002.</p><p>Jackson, who <a href=#>died in 2009</a>, had said that he’s the biological father of the children.</p><p>Klein was Jackson’s dermatologist; speculation has been swirling for years over his relationship to Prince and Paris and whether they are actually his children. Klein previously has denied that he’s the father.</p><p><a href=#><strong>STORY: Michael Jackson Memorial: A View From Inside</strong></a></p><p>A representative for Klein “that was not Dr. Klein’s post, and he removed it.” The post is now missing from Klein’s <a href=# rel=nofollow>timeline.</a></p><p>An attorney for <strong>Katherine Jackson</strong>, the kids’ grandmother <a href=#>and co-guardian </a>with their cousin <strong>TJ Jackson</strong>, declined comment.&nbsp;</p><p>According to a recent Klein profile <a href=# rel=nofollow>in Vanity Fair</a>, Rowe was Klein’s medical assistant; she confirmed after Jackson’s death that Prince and Paris were conceived artificially but never has spoken publicly about whether Klein is the father.</p><p>In a January 2012 interview with <a href=# rel=nofollow>The New York Times</a>, Klein’s close friend, actress <strong>Carrie Fisher</strong>, had this response when asked about the paternity rumors: “I don’t talk about it with Arnie, but it has never made sense to me. Why would Michael pay Debbie Rowe $6 million for a child that wasn’t his? But I have said to Arnie, ‘Please don’t say you’re the father anymore.’ “</p><p>Twitter: <a href=# rel=nofollow>@ErinLCarlson</a></p><p>Email: erin.carlson@thr.com</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue82erqxnl5q7pr7ApWSnnaeofK61wqGYnqRdn66kt9KopaxllJq%2Frq3TqKOon5mowW65yKCfrWWYlsOmeZNqamtuYWQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
