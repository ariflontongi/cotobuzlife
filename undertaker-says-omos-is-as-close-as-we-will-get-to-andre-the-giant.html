The match was a resounding success and received a lot of critical praise from fans and Superstars alike.&nbsp;</p><p>While speaking on <a href=#>WWE’s The Bump</a>, The Undertaker talked about Omos’ run in WWE so far. The Undertaker stated that Omos is ‘as close as we’ve come’ to another Andre The Giant and that he should be protected as much as possible.</p><p>“I’ll say this. There will never be another Andre. But this guy is as close as we’ve come and that’s a big statement. But he’s special. Omos is special. The big thing for him to know and realize is that he is special and that he is different from everybody else.</p><p>The average size of wrestlers, in general, is smaller than it was. So here’s this guy that is incredibly athletic and he’s just a big strong man. It’s important for him that he protects that. Sometimes guys don’t understand what that means. He and I have had a couple of conversations about what he should do and what he shouldn’t do. If things get too heated, call me.”</p><p>At WrestleMania 37 in April, AJ Styles and Omos won the Raw Tag Team Championship and held the titles for 132 days. Omos also won. The Rock 25th Anniversary 25-Man Battle Royal at the WWE Survivor Series pay-per-view. It remains to be seen what is next in store for Omos.</p><p>h/t to <a href=#>WrestlingInc</a> for the quotes.</p><p><strong>What’s your take on this story?
