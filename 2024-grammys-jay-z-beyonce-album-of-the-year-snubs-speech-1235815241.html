He noted that he “took a page out of their book” when he was nominated for best rap album in 1998, but the late DMX didn’t receive any nominations.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“We want ya’ll to get it right. We love ya’ll. At least get it close to right. And obviously, it’s subjective because it’s music. And it’s opinion-based,” he continued.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">He then addressed his wife, Beyoncé, never winning in the top category of album of the year.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">During last year’s Grammys, Beyoncé <a href=#>made awards show history </a>by winning a record 32 awards.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“I don’t want to embarrass this young lady, but she has the most Grammys than everyone and never won album of the year. So even by your own metrics, that doesn’t work. Think about that: The most Grammys. Never won album of the year. That doesn’t work. Some of you gonna go home and feel like you’ve been robbed. Some of you may get robbed. Some of you don’t belong in the category,” he said, getting an audible reaction from the audience.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“When I get nervous I tell the truth,” he added.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“But outside of that, we got to keep showing up,” he continued. “Keep showing up until they give you all those accolades you feel you deserve. Until they call you chairman. Until they call you genius. Until they call you the greatest of all time.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Throughout his career, Jay-Z has won 24 Grammys and received 88 nominations. The rapper won his first Grammy for best rap album for&nbsp;Vol. 2 … Hard Knock Life&nbsp;in 1998. He currently holds the distinction of rapper with the most Grammy wins in history, tied with Kanye West.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Following Jay-Z’s honor, DJ Khaled <a href=# rel=nofollow>shared a video </a>on social media of the rapper drinking alcohol out of his Grammy statue that he poured into it. “Beautiful speech (cloth talk ) HOV DID<br>Keep showing up till THEY say you the greatest of all time,” DJ Khaled wrote.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">For this year’s <a href=#>Grammys</a>, female acts made up seven of the eight nominees in the top three categories — with&nbsp;SZA&nbsp;leading with nine overall nominations, followed by&nbsp;Taylor Swift,&nbsp;Olivia Rodrigo,&nbsp;Billie Eilish,&nbsp;Miley Cyrus&nbsp;and boygenius with six nods a piece.
