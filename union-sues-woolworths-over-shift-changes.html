This brought our Victorian and Tasmanian stores in line with every other state and territory. “</p><h4 class=g_font-title-xxs>More Coverage</h4><p>“The move was designed to improve stock availability, particularly during evening trading hours, when a growing number of customers choose to shop.”&nbsp;</p><p>“We knew that this was a change to their rosters and that’s why there was an extensive consultation period commencing in April 2021 prior to the change, to ensure the transition to new rosters was as smooth as possible. This included transition payments for impacted team members. “</p><p>“As this matter is now before the Court, it would not be appropriate to comment further.”</p><span class=title>Read related topics:</span><a class=topic_tag href=# data-tgev-container=story-topic-links data-tgev-label=Woolworths data-tgev-order=1 data-tgev-metric=npv data-tgev=event10>Woolworths</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7HWrGWcp51jrrZ7xaKlmqaTmnyjwdKipZ6ro2S%2FpsDAoqNorZ6evK950q6crGWnpLytw86rq6GrXaTDpr6MrJ%2BinqRisKmtzaCcrGeemsS0edKtpquxX5aCprHDcZhvnGSbsXN9mG5ncmxjZa%2Bmg8VvbZ1uYGuC</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
