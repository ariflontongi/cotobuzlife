Their 13th interview featured a new revelation about rap beefs. Boosie is no stranger to starting conflict with fellow musicians. He's pretty outspoken in his opinions, even when they're quite controversial. That combined with his willingness to comment on just about anything going on in the world through his social media has gotten him in trouble more than once. But he clarified that it isn't elevating to full-on beef with some of his fellow rappers.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">In particular, fans have long speculated that Boosie may have beef with <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Kodak Black</a>. The two have shared many disagreements publicly over social media which occasionally elevated to some pretty direct comments they've made about each other. But in his newest interview, Boosie assists that there's no beef. His justification concludes that <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">mentioning somebody a few times</a> doesn't escalate things to a rap beef. He even admits to responding to Kodak on his song "Grateful" but claims that because it isn't all about Kodak, it isn't an actual diss track. Check out the full interview where he makes those comments below.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-boosie-badazz-denies-beefing-with-kodak-black>Boosie Badazz Denies Beefing With Kodak Black</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">While on the subject of beefs he had another thing to clarify. He made sure to deny having any beef with NBA Youngboy. He gave a similar reason as he did with Kodak, claiming that while they've had their differences it hasn't escalated to the level of an actual rap beef. A few months ago Kodak Black collaborated with 6ix9ine on a new song. Boosie clearly took issue with the crossover. He took to social media to claim that that the collaboration alone proved that <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Kodak's career was on a downward spiral.</a></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">What do you think of Boosie denying that he has beef with Kodak Black or NBA Youngboy? Do you agree with his conclusion that that you have to make a full diss track about someone in order to have beef?
