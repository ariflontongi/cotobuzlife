Minaj also expressed her frustration that Cardi B spoke out about the single, admitting that she hadn’t listened to Minaj’s verse.&nbsp;</p><p>“The only thing with Cardi that really, really hurt my feelings was the first interview she did after ‘Motorsport’ came out,” Minaj <a href=#>said</a>. “I remember when I first came in the game, if a female of that stature had done a feature with me on it, I would only be singing their praises and saying thank you. The first interview she did after ‘Motorsport’ came out, it just really hurt me. She looked so aggravated and angry and the only thing she said was, ‘Oh, I didn’t hear that. I didn’t hear that verse.’ I was like, what?”</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p>During her&nbsp;Instagram rant, Cardi B said she has been “dying to talk to about” their complicated association on the song. “You changed your verse two or three times and the day before we were supposed to do the ‘Motorsport’ video,” Cardi B said, proceeding to show the “receipts” on her phone of her attempts to contact Minaj to discuss their song. “I called you twice and you didn’t answer, and I told my label I’m not doing the video if she&nbsp;don’t&nbsp;change the verse,” Cardi B explained, as she visibly showed Minaj’s alleged phone number listed in her call history. &nbsp;</p><p>In regards to Minaj claiming Cardi B did not say “thank you” for collaborating together, the rapper fired back: “You never helped me to get into this fucking career.” The rapper also argued that if Minaj truly had a problem with her speaking about their song’s release, she didn’t have to wait “a whole six months.” “You waited a whole six months when you dropped a single to talk about it,” said Cardi B. “How convenient is that?”&nbsp;</p><p>In her series of Instagram videos, Cardi B also addressed their infamous <a href=#>altercation</a> during New York Fashion Week, to which Minaj claims the rapper attacked her.</p><p>“How you say when I was the wild animal, that I attacked you, that you was mortified, that you was humiliated, playing the victim and now you’re the gangster,” the rapper said. “You need to pick a side — do you want to be the victim or do you want to be the gangster? You lie so much, you can’t even keep up with your fucking lies.”</p><p>“I know what there’s footage of. You standing on the wall talking about ‘I’m standing right here,’ Miss Chun-Li the street fighter, get the fuck out of here,” she continued.&nbsp;</p><p>Cardi B’s 10-part video explanation comes hours after Minaj’s&nbsp;latest&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow>Queen Radio</a>&nbsp;Beats 1 episode, <a href=#>in which the “Barbie Dreams” rapper took aim at her.</a></p><p>“What you need to do is stop focusing on other people,&nbsp;focus on yourself and focus on your craft, because you’re out here fucking up your legacy, looking like a fucking hater,” Cardi B ended.</p><p>See it all unfold, below.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href=# rel=nofollow>2</a></p><p>A post shared by <a href=# rel=nofollow>CARDIVENOM</a> (@iamcardib) on Oct 29, 2018 at 3:36pm PDT</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p>This story first appeared on <a href=#>Billboard.com</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue82erqxnnarAqq%2BMp5ywq1%2BYrrOwyGaZZqSVlri0ec2imqShXaK2r63JrGSpoJ%2Bjsm661KaZnqpdlsBussSum2ado5iura3TnqpmaWFqg3KCl2g%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
