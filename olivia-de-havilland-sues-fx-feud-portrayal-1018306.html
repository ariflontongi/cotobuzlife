Olivia de Havilland is suing the network and Ryan Murphy Productions over her portrayal by Catherine Zeta-Jones in Feud: Bette and Joan. 
In a complaint filed Friday in L.A. County Superior Court, de Havilland claims she has built a reputation for integrity and dignity by refraining from gossip and other unkind, ill-mannered behavior — but the series opens with Zeta-Jones doing an interview as de Havilland and creates the impression that she was a hypocrite who sold gossip to promote herself."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Did that happen? What was your take on that?'” he said.&nbsp;</p><p>She also takes issue with Feud‘s references to her relationship with her sister.</p><p>“Zeta-Jones’ de <span data-scayt_word=Havilland data-scaytid=25>Havilland</span> refers to&nbsp;Joan Fontaine as her ‘bitch sister,’ an offensive term that stands in stark contrast with Olivia de <span data-scayt_word="Havilland's" data-scaytid=26>Havilland’s</span>&nbsp;reputation for good manners, class and kindness,” writes Smith.&nbsp;</p><p>The actress says defendants knew or recklessly disregarded publicly available information that she is alive, she never gave an interview about the relationship between Davis and Crawford, and that she maintains a reputation for avoiding gossip mongering.</p><p>In April, de <span data-scayt_word=Havilland data-scaytid=27>Havilland</span> told <span data-scayt_word=THR data-scaytid=29>THR</span>&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>she hadn’t seen the show</a>, but “in principle, I am opposed to any representation of personages who are no longer alive to judge the accuracy of any incident depicted as involving themselves.” Apparently, she’s seen it now and she isn’t pleased.</p><p>“Each FX defendant knew ‘Feud’ would be more successful if they placed an individual like Olivia de <span data-scayt_word=Havilland data-scaytid=30>Havilland</span>, who is known for her honesty and integrity, at the forefront of the story,” writes Smith. “Her credibility, as both the only living person of significance portrayed in&nbsp;‘Feud’ and as a reliable source who was close to the action, added to the success of ‘Feud’ at the&nbsp;expense of Olivia de <span data-scayt_word=Havilland data-scaytid=31>Havilland</span>.”</p><p>She’s suing for infringement of common law right of publicity, invasion of privacy and unjust enrichment and is asking the court for not only damages but also any profits gained from the use of her likeness and an injunction to keep FX from continuing to use her name and likeness.</p><p>FX declined to comment on the complaint, which is posted in full below.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue8GuqqKmlajAcK7UrKCnnaOoeq%2Bx1qxmqKSZq7aiecOeZKGZpp65ra3NnWSsrZWoeqfEjJ%2BcrpxdpbyzwNGasJqkXWZ9coSSaW1o</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
