State of Combat podcast recently spoke to Jon Moxley where he explained how AEW comes up with their stories. It is a collaborative effort across the board and nobody is afraid of “reprisals” because there is no Vince McMahon role as final decision maker."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

He realizes those differences and seems to really appreciate the opportunities that All Elite Wrestling has given him to represent himself in a way he wants to be seen.</p><p><a href=#>State of Combat podcast</a> recently spoke to Jon Moxley where he explained how AEW comes up with their stories. It is a collaborative effort across the board and nobody is afraid of “reprisals” because there is no Vince McMahon role as final decision maker. In the end, he has the final decision of how he is represented on television.</p><p>“Pretty much it’s a collaborative effort. There are so many great ideas that come in. I’m hearing really good ideas. I have full control in that I am not going to go out there and do anything that makes me look stupid, at least not on purpose, which is a giant weight off of my shoulders.”</p><p>“Everybody has ideas. Everyone adds their own flavors to the mix to get all of these talented, super-creative guys that have no fear of reprisals. There are no higher-ups to make sure we have to please. It is super-creative guys who don’t give a damn what anyone thinks. We’re trying to put on something that we will like and that we think people will like. You get to play your music your way and hope people will appreciate it, but whatever it is, it is authentic and honest.”</p><p>AEW is just getting off to the races. They just breached into double digits with the number of Dynamite episodes under their belt and there will be plenty more to come.</p><p>We’ll have to see how things evolve from this point on, but Jon Moxley seems to have nothing but good things to say about AEW creative at this point.</p><p>Thanks to <a href=#>Wrestling Inc </a>for the quote</p><span class=author-name>Felix Upton</span> <span></span><p>Felix Upton is a seasoned writer with over 30 years of experience.
