According to the <a href=#>Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) wiki</a>, Asgardian King Odin was the one to apparently finish up the war with the Frost Giants, around 965 A.D., after the Frost Giants had attempted to invade Earth.</p><p>Things didn't really stop there, says the <a href=#>MCU wiki</a>, thanks to a fateful discovery made by Odin after battle. Entering an empty temple, he found a small baby on an altar. Unlike other Frost Giant children, this one was small and weak. This was the son of Laufey, the Frost Giant King, who was unwilling to raise such a child. Odin adopted the baby, named him Loki, and cast a powerful enchantment to conceal his distinctive blue skin and red eyes. Odin hoped that Loki would be convenient, perhaps one day ruling over the Frost Giants as a king friendly to Asgard.</p><p><a href=#>Clinical and Practice Issues in Adoption</a> points out that many people who are adopted develop anxieties centering on this first abandonment, even if their biological and adoptive families are loving and transparent. Odin, however, took another path that ultimately compounded this trauma. He raised Loki as his biological son, never telling him or his brother, Thor, the truth. When Loki inevitably discovered his actual heritage, the pain and grief of this revelation was all the more explosive for this lie.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB%2Bl2lqa3Bfqb%2Bis8icZJ2dpJa2rb%2BMmpmoraRiuqK%2B1Z6jrGWcpLiqew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
