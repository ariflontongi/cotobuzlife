When discussion the nature of death of plants and animals, Tolkien says that elves will kill animals and plants for substance, and that while they may not like to do so, it is "their nature to be fed" and that they "have a right to live". So they need to eat to surivive.<h2>Do elves eat meat?</h2>In fact, there's a good bit of evidence to suggest that they did eat meat. There are several mentions in all three stories of elves hunting (and I find it hard to believe that they would do so purely for sport, without eating the meat of the animals they killed.)<h2>What do elves drink?</h2>Just like you, elves cannot survive on food alone! When it comes time to wash down a meal, elves drink a lot of the same beverages as you: a cold glass of milk with their chocolate chip cookies, freshly squeezed orange juice or even North Pole snow melted to make a glass of water.<h2>The Hobbit Extended Rivendell Dinner HD</h2><p></p><h2>Do elves eat babies?</h2>As with fairies, elves were said to secretly steal healthy human babies and replace them with their own kind. These changelings appeared at first glance to be human babies, but if they became seriously sick or temperamental, parents would sometimes suspect that their own child had been abducted by elves.<h2>What do elves smell like?</h2>I'm willing to bet that male elves smell like freshly cut grass, whereas females - like a bouquet of flowers. It makes sense, given their connection to forests, and magical physiology.<h2>Do elves sleep?</h2>Elves definitely do sleep (though it seems they don't need to, necessarily.) Turgon and Finrod were sleeping when Ulmo visited them in their dreams, and the guards at Mirkwood passed out after drinking too much in The Hobbit.<h2>Do elves get cold?</h2>Elves do seem to have more resistance to cold– c.f. Legolas wearing only “light shoes” on Caradhras; I believe that's what started the “fanon” idea that they don't feel cold at all, under any circumstances– which is certainly not the case, as you've just demonstrated.<h2>Do elves drink?</h2>Well, the Hobbit shows that Elves can certainly get themselves drunk. They can also be killed by poison, so presumably an Elf could theoretically drink themselves to death. However, they would be unlikely to suffer much from the long term physiological effects of drinking.<h2>What are elves 4 main food groups?</h2>Like an elf, if you try to stick to the four main food groups of candy, candy canes, candy corns and syrup, you'll love this restaurant's take on Buddy the Elf's famous spaghetti recipe.<h2>What four food groups can elves eat?</h2>We elves try to stick to the four main food groups: candy, candy canes, candy corns and syrup.<h2>Do elves get periods?</h2>((EDIT: Although ti's very possible - even likely, that menstruation wasn't actually a monthly cycle. Elves rarely even counted in years (preferring centuries), let alone months.)) So, long story short, I'm pretty confident that elves do menstruate.<h2>Do elves only fall in love once?</h2>By their very nature, they are "seldom swayed by the desires of the body" or influenced by lust. They marry only once for it was ruled by Manwë that, "'since the Elves are by nature permanent in life within Arda, so also is their unmarred marriage.<h2>Can elves be killed?</h2>Elves are immortal, and remain unwearied with age. They can recover from wounds which would be fatal to a Man, but can be killed in battle. Spirits of dead Elves go to the Halls of Mandos in Valinor.<h2>What is a female elf called?</h2>elven (plural elvens) Originally, a female elf, a fairy, a nymph; (by extension) any elf. [<h2>What colors are Elves?</h2>They typically have fair skin and hair that runs in hues from silver-white to black or blue. While human style hair colors are rare, eye color can be remarkably similar, with colors ranging from blue to green. The majority of the half-elves in Faerûn come from parings between humans and moon elves.<h2>Can a elf on the shelf have a baby?</h2>To answer the burning question, no, Elf on the Shelf can't have babies.<h2>What does middle earth smell like?</h2>So, in The Hobbit, when Bilbo and the dwarves are entering the valley of Imladris, Bilbo says “Hmmm! It smells like elves!” And, sure enough, that's about when the elves show up.<h2>What would Rivendell smell like?</h2>There are references in The Fellowship of the Ring to the smell of the trees and grass of Lothlórien (p. 340), and even “a faint scent of trees and flowers” in Rivendell (p. 220), but these are describing Elvish places, places (I would add) preserved by the power of the Three Rings.<h2>What does a Hobbit Hole smell like?</h2>Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a hobbit-hole, and that means comfort. It had a perfectly round door like a porthole, painted green, with a shiny yellow brass knob in the exact middle.<h2>What do Elves call humans?</h2>Because they awoke at the start of the Years of the Sun, long after the Elves, the elves called them the "afterborn", or in Quenya the Atani, the "Second People". Like Elves, Men first awoke in the East of Middle-earth, spreading all over the continent and developing a variety of cultures and ethnicities.<h2>Are Elves real?</h2>From a scientific viewpoint, elves are not considered objectively real. However, elves have in many times and places been believed to be real beings.<h2>What does an Elf wear?</h2>Christmas elves are usually depicted as green- or red-clad, with large, pointy ears and wearing pointy hats.<h2>How do elves have babies?</h2>How Do Elves Reproduce In The Lord Of The Rings? Elves have sexual intercourse, just as we do. This, by the way, is why Elves and Men can reproduce and have fertile Half-Elven offspring.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrTnqmvoZWsrrOxwGeaqKVfm66ye9ahmK1llKR6prjVnqpmnZGpeqK6w2abq6GeoA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
