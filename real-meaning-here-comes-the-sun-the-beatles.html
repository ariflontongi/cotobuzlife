Apple Corps put out music by other musicians, among other things, but was mostly a tax dodge, according to <a href=#>NPR</a>. It was also a time suck for Harrison and the others. According to&nbsp;<a href=#>"I, Me, Mine,"</a>&nbsp;<a href=#>George Harrison</a> thought of Apple as having to attend school "where we had to go and be businessmen" who had to "sign this and sign that."</p><p>Per&nbsp;<a href=#>"Story of 'Abbey Road' and the End of the Beatles,"</a>&nbsp;Eric Clapton later recalled that it "was a beautiful spring morning" and he and Harrison were sitting in a big field at the back of his garden on his country estate. They were strumming their guitars and singing "de da de de, it's been a long cold lonely winter." Between the sunshine and Harrison's relief at "not having to go see all those dopey accountants" a new song began to take shape. Harrison later finished the lyrics during a holiday with his wife Pattie in Sardinia in June, per "<a href=#>The Beatles' Recorded Legacy, Volume 2"</a>&nbsp;and <a href=#>"The Beatles Book."</a>&nbsp;That summer, Harrison played the new tune for his bandmates for the first time.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB9kmlranFkZL%2BmrctmpJ6Znp67qHnHnqmeZZOkuqa%2FjK2fnmWjqrtuwMeeZJudkam5pr%2BO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
