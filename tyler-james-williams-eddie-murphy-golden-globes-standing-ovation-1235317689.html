Murphy was at the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>ceremony to accept</a> the Cecil B.

Williams continued, “So I spent the next three or four days after the Globes trying to get in contact with Eddie Murphy to say, ‘I didn’t see you — I’m so sorry. But you mean the world to me.’ So I’m just now processing the Globe because I spent so much time trying to process that.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Fallon then said that Murphy is known to watch The Tonight Show, leading Williams to look into the camera and thank the Beverly Hills Cop star for the gesture.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue9OvZq2uXaOyuL%2BOrbClnaJit6K5xKxksKGcobaiudJmnJ2cmZp6rsHRqZ%2ByZZekuaWxzWaepaeSmsBuv9OapZ2hnpx6sMLAraCopl1mf3SBkmpub3BpZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
