Cashing in on what could potentially be the end of the Broncos’ season, <a href=# rel=nofollow>USA Today</a> published a wide-ranging exclusive interview with the team’s star player, which attempts to shed light on the 24-year-old behind Tebow’s larger-than-life persona. &nbsp;</p><p>“I don’t have to live the roller coaster other people live with my life,” Tebow says. “It’s hard because people try to have an effect. I try to stay centered in my faith and my family and the close people around me.”</p><p>Combining his unwavering religion and charitable deeds with athletic prowess, Tebow seems a far cry from the sports superstars who often make headlines for outlandish behavior and bad-boy personas. In a world full of booze, drugs and girls, Tebow admits to a different sort of vice.</p><p>“Love ice cream,” he says. “I let myself have that about once a week. Vanilla.”</p><p>“The biggest reason I don’t (consume alcohol) is because (if I have) a glass of wine, I don’t want to be responsible for a kid looking up to me and saying, ‘Hey, Tebow’s doin’ it — I am going to do it.’ And then he makes a bad decision,” he confessed. ” Because, like it or not, it is serious.”</p><p><strong><a href=# rel=nofollow>PHOTOS: 10 Broadcast and Cable TV Show Most Watched By Men</a></strong></p><p>The athlete also sets the record straight on the <strong>Lindsay Vonn</strong> rumors (she’s a family friend, not a romantic interest), and explains that while he loves “meeting and talking with new people,” he is also “careful about leading girls on.”</p><p>While his peers are out partying, Tebow — a self proclaimed homebody — can be found “hangin’ out with my siblings and close friends. It is my favorite thing to do in the world. Love laughing – love tellin’ jokes. I really try to enjoy life and have joy with what I do.”</p><p>To read more from Tebow’s interview, <a href=# rel=nofollow>click here</a>.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue82erqxnl5q7pr7ApWSnnaeofLW1zGarnpqfrHqlsc2vnKtlkqe8r6%2FOrGSipqSav7e1xLBkp56cYr2trdionZ%2BrXWeFcoOQbmY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
