&#34;A woman who cuts her hair is about to change her life,&#34; said Coco Chanel, a woman known for her sage wisdom. It's a maxim that could easily be applied to why women have post-break-up haircuts.
We've all been there. You split with your partner and when the crying ends, and you stop aesthetically unravelling around about the same time you start brushing your teeth again, there arises a niggling desire to change something dramatic about your appearance."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

It's a maxim that could easily be applied to why women have post-break-up haircuts.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">We've all been there. You split with your partner and when the crying ends, and you stop aesthetically unravelling around about the same time you start brushing your teeth again, there arises a niggling desire to change something dramatic about your appearance. And something makes you focus on your hair, which now in the cold light of your break-up looks tired and dull. And then comes the great chop: a signal of the new post-split you.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It's not an uncommon move. Katy Perry, <a data-tracking-id=recirc-text-link href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/celebrities-1/news/a40170/katy-perry-and-orlando-bloom-have-split-up/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="fresh from her separation from Orlando Bloom" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">fresh from her separation from Orlando Bloom</a>, recently <a data-tracking-id=recirc-text-link href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/beauty/hair/news/a40255/katy-perry-break-up-haircut-miley-cyrus-orlando-bloom/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="cut off her shoulder-length hair to reveal a punk-like crop" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">cut off her shoulder-length hair to reveal a punk-like crop</a> much like Miley Cyrus, Rihanna and Scarlett Johansson before her, telling the press that she wanted to "redefine what it means to be feminine". Men are not immune to the break-up hairdo either. Perhaps it was a coincidence, but Lenny Kravitz cut off his dreadlocks following his Nineties split from Vanessa Paradis, saying "I needed to change my energy, so I cut my hair. Now, I'm growing some new energy."</p><img alt="Katy Perry" title="Katy Perry" width=2000 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/harpersbazaaruk.cdnds.net/17/10/1488905371-katy-perry.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-esp0ot e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">Getty Images</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It comes as no surprise that there is more to this than meets the eye. There is, of course, an idea of metaphorical lightness that comes with chopping off one's locks. The relationship and sex educator Dr Laura Berman thinks it is a coping mechanism, much like the idea of dressing yourself 'confident' or 'happy' even if you feel lost or sad.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"When you feel poorly, it is natural to make changes to your external body in the hopes that it will make you feel better internally as well," Berman told <a data-tracking-id=recirc-text-link href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.instyle.com/news/haircut-breakup-connection data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=InStyle class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">InStyle</a>. "There is something about a drastic cut that can feel cathartic after a break-up, like you are cutting off the dead weight and becoming lighter and freer."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Whether you end the relationship or not, there is a lack of control that comes with a break-up. Depending on the how long you have been together, there is usually major life adjustment that accompanies heartbreak. Either way, you have to grieve for a loss. The clinical psychologist Seema Hingorrany told <a data-tracking-id=recirc-text-link href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/relationships/love-sex/Break-ups-and-haircuts-whats-the-connection/articleshow/38363164.cms data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The Times of India" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">The Times of India</a> that "many women feel like their hair or appearance is still that one thing they have absolute control over. So, when they decide to chop off their tresses, it is mostly to adopt a new, fresher identity. The girl feels an intense need to move on and hence, the need to look different and new."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The hairstylist Eloise Cheung agrees. "Dramatic hair changes are a way of shedding the past and moving on," she told <a data-tracking-id=recirc-text-link href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://hellogiggles.com/women-cut-hair-breakup/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=HelloGiggles class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">HelloGiggles</a>. "We're on a mission to create a new and better version of ourselves and a fast and easy way to do this is by cutting our hair and/or changing our hair colour."</p><img alt="Bella Hadid" title="Bella Hadid" width=2000 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/harpersbazaaruk.cdnds.net/17/10/1488906281-bella-hadid.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-esp0ot e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">Getty Images</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Bella Hadid is one such example of the post-split hair-colour change, dyeing her brown locks close to black, only weeks after it emerged that her ex-boyfriend, Abel Tesfaye of The Weeknd, was dating Selena Gomez. "I just needed a change in my life," she said. "I think when you dye and cut your hair it takes away a lot of past resolutions."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">However, while the urge to try the undercut/bob/pixie crop you've always pondered over seems tempting, Alexa Chung – who always has flawless hair – says tread with caution.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"It's the first thing women do, but you're not in a fit state to make decisions that are long-term – you'll have to spend the next four years growing it out," she told <a data-tracking-id=recirc-text-link href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.stylist.co.uk/beauty/alexa-chung-the-hair-memoirs data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Stylist class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Stylist</a>. "Don't have a fringe cut. Don't bleach it. Don't do anything, because you will regret it. Buy a lipstick instead. Go and kiss loads of other people, but don't fucking touch your hair, as you'll still feel sad – and you'll have weird hair."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">That said, it's just hair – it'll always grow back.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">...</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfqrhwrsSarK2xX52uqr6Op5ywq1%2BWgXF%2BmG9mraCZqHqqv4ywn7Jlp6S6prqMq5yapJyueqTB02amn55dqbWmtdFmn5qhomK9sL%2FTZpmrnZGgera8jg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
