As he described to <a href=#>Entertainment Tonight</a>, there are still issues in their relationship. "When you go to boarding school at 7 years old, it's kind of hard to feel like you're not being shunned," he said. "But I'm at an age where I'm making peace with it because you just have to. But I still ... it doesn't mean it's right. It's still wrong to do that."&nbsp;</p><p>At the time of the interview, Elijah confessed that his relationship with his mom was still rocky and they hadn't spoken in months. "You know, man, we have our issues," he said. "We've worked through a lot of them. We've got some more to go, but when you're an adult, you take on a different sort of tone than when you're an adolescent and I'm not going to sit in an adolescent's kind of a mind frame, because that will affect me negatively in my own life when I start my own family. So you don't have any choice if you want to be a balanced person, but to ultimately heal. But, there's unresolved stuff, for sure." Above all, he's still loves his mom and is a fan. "You know, she's really talented," Elijah quipped. "She's gorgeous—I mean, she's Cher. What's not to love?"</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmb3BmboBwwc2tpqWcXam%2FtsDHZpqhnaJk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
