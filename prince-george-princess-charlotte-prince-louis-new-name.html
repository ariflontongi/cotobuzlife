In the uniqueness that is royal life, this means that George, Charlotte, and Louis have new surnames—formerly George Cambridge, Charlotte Cambridge, and Louis Cambridge to reflect their parents’ Duke and Duchess of Cambridge titles, now that William and Kate are Prince and Princess of Wales, the kids are now George Wales, Charlotte Wales, and Louis Wales. (When William and brother <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-auto-tag-linker=true data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/tag/prince-harry/>Prince Harry</a> were in school, they were known as William Wales and Harry Wales, to reflect their parents’ Prince and Princess of Wales titles.)</p><p>Think about it this way: on Thursday, their first day of school, their new teachers and fellow students at Lambrook met them with one last name (Cambridge)—and by the next day, they had a completely different last name (Wales). That’s confusing for anyone at any age, let alone at ages nine, seven, and four.</p><p>In his address yesterday, <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-auto-tag-linker=true data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/tag/king-charles/>King Charles</a> III said “today, I am proud to create him [William] Prince of Wales, Tywysog Cymru, the country whose title I have been so greatly privileged to bear during so much of my life and duty. With Catherine beside him, our new Prince and Princess of Wales will, I know, continue to inspire and lead our national conversations, helping to bring the marginal to the center ground where vital help can be given.”</p><p>According to<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://people.com/royals/prince-george-prince-charlotte-prince-louis-new-surnames-under-king-charles-iii/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none> <u>PEOPLE</u></a>, as William and Kate take on these new titles, they are focused on “deepening the trust and respect of the people of Wales over time,” adding “the Prince and Princess of Wales will approach their roles in the modest and humble way they’ve approached their work previously.”</p><p>In addition to a change in their last name, all three kids have moved up in the line of succession and are now second, third, and fourth in line. Charlotte’s place as now third in line is especially poignant, as prior to a 2013 succession law, she would have been bumped to fourth in line in favor of her brother, Louis. The 2013 law allows the Crown to pass on in order of birth, regardless of gender. Before 2013, succession rules stated the Crown would pass to the eldest male heir and only to a female heir when there were no other male heirs available—case in point, Princess Anne, who is the Queen’s second oldest child, yet is below her younger brothers Prince Andrew and <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-auto-tag-linker=true data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/tag/prince-edward/>Prince Edward</a> in the line of succession.</p><p>“That might seem like a minor thing, but it is a very big victory for equality,” William previously said of the amendment. “It says to people, which [the Queen] proved more than anyone, that a monarch is a job, and a woman can do it just as well as a man.”</p><p class=newsletter-form__strapline>Marie Claire email subscribers get intel on fashion and beauty trends, hot-off-the-press celebrity news, and more.
