Vision captured just after 10am on Tuesday, shows the B-double truck drifting into a nearby bike lane then mounting the footpath along Hampstead Road.
The truck can be seen charging through a road sign and knocking over a light pole before speeding through an intersection, narrowly missing a hatchback waiting at a red light."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

He reportedly told Mr Brackley he fainted behind the wheel.</p><p>DTL Timbers, the driver’s company, told 7News Adelaide he had a medical episode behind the wheel and sustained minor injuries in the incident. A spokesman said he was “still trying to recall what happened” but was “really grateful that nobody was injured in any way, shape or form”.</p><p>That sentiment was echoed by South Australian Police Minister Joe Szakcas.</p><p>“(For a) massive, heavy truck take out that infrastructure and come so close to homes is really scary, and I’m just really thankful this wasn’t worse than it was,” he told 9News.</p><h4 class=g_font-title-xxs>More Coverage</h4><p>Mr Brackley said it was “miraculous no one was killed” on the road, footpath, or front yards when the truck barrelled down the usually-busy Hampstead Road – which is part of a major arterial route through the eastern suburbs of Adelaide.</p><p>“The truck was making a hell of a noise when I got there and I was thinking, could it blow up? Or what could happen?” Mr Brackley said.</p><p>The collision impacted gas and water lines in the area, and days later residents are still faced with a massive clean-up on their hands.</p><span class=title>Read related topics:</span><a class=topic_tag href=# data-tgev-container=story-topic-links data-tgev-label=Adelaide data-tgev-order=1 data-tgev-metric=npv data-tgev=event10>Adelaide</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7HWrGWcp51jrrZ7056aoaafobyoxY6mpq2nop67qHvOp2StoJViv7Ctw2irq62ToHq0ucCsn56rXam1s7vUoJ9mmZSauaK1w55km62jYsC1u89moKdlpJq%2Fs7XFsqCnn12ZrrS0wpqkZq6ZmbKwe82erqxlo6m8s8WOmp1wm2hrg6SCkmuZbmhjZoV1g8FwnJ5vYWawcrHCnGc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
