(Yikes.) Let’s back up a minute: Berry went on Instagram to post the words “Sometimes you have to be the bigger guy…Even if you’re a woman!” After a fan commented on the post and asked what Berry thought about Drake using the aforementioned photo for his new single with SZA, she replied “Didn’t get my permission.
