By Jessica Goudreault | Updated 10 months ago A new Star Wars movie would look a lot different with Helen Mirren cast as Rey, but that was almost the case. Daisy Ridley, who has been the new face of Star Wars since 2015, was almost replaced by the older British actress for a new movie, according to The Direct."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Daisy Ridley, who has been the new face of Star Wars since 2015, was almost replaced by the older British actress for a new movie, according to <a href=#>The Direct</a>. After the script changed and new writers came on board, <a href=#>Lucasfilm</a> has confirmed that Daisy Ridley will make her return as Rey in the upcoming Star Wars movie, Star Wars: New Jedi Order.</p><p>Originally, writers <a href=#>Damon Lindelof</a> and Justin Britt-Gibson were working on the script for a new Star Wars film and had the idea to set it 60 years in the future, hence why they needed an older actress to play Rey. Now, a new script for Star Wars: <a href=#>New Jedi Order</a> will take place just&nbsp;15 years after&nbsp;Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, making it much easier for Daisy Ridley to reprise her role. While there is still much work to be done on the film, the plot will focus on Rey building a new Jedi Order, as the title suggests. &nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/daisy-ridley-900x506.jpg><p>Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy is set to direct Daisy Ridley’s comeback film, Star Wars: New&nbsp;Jedi&nbsp;Order. The Pakistani-Canadian journalist, producer, and director is new to the Star Wars franchise, as she has previously focused on films about gender inequality, including Saving Face, A Girl in the River: The Price of Forgiveness, and A Journey of a Thousand Miles: Peacekeepers. We can expect excellent work from Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy, who has won several impressive awards for her outstanding documentaries and journalism efforts.</p><p>The new sci-fi film will mark Daisy Riley’s fourth Star Wars film after she starred in Star Wars: The Force Awakens (2015), Star Wars: The Last Jedi (2017), and Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker (2019). Since her last Star Wars film, the 31-year-old actress has branched out from the sci-fi realm and been cast in two comedy films: Sometimes I Think About Dying and The Bubble. She also has several films that are in the works, including The Marsh King’s Daughter, Young Woman and the Sea, and Magpie (which she is also producing).</p><p>In addition to Daisy Ridley reprising her role as Rey, <a href=#>John Boyega</a> might also reprise his role as Finn in&nbsp;Star Wars: New&nbsp;Jedi&nbsp;Order. John Boyega’s character was last seen in The Rise of Skywalker, having found a group of other former Stormtroopers. He never did finish telling Rey whatever he wanted to say before the quicksand swallowed them up, so maybe, 15 years later, he can finally finish his sentence.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue8Snq2ickZ7AunnRopulnaliv6a8y5qanpxdp7K6esetpKU%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
