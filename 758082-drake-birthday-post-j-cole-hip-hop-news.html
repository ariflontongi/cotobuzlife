One of the biggest stars in all of music often uses his platforms to speak on various issues or just to update fans on what he's doing and who he's hanging out with. That was the case last week when he weighed in on the leaking of <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Young Thug</a>'s jail phone call with Mariah The Scientist. He called out the judge in the case and doubled down on the theory that Thugger could have a lawsuit on his hands.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">But in a much less dramatic move, he took to his Instagram story earlier today to share birthday wishes. Those wishes were directed at Drake's collaborator <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>J. Cole</a>. "More life my brother thank you for the years of inspiration @realcoleworld" the caption of the post reads. It comes over top of a black-and-white picture of the rapper during a performance. The pair have crossed paths musically a few times before. Most notably, they dropped "First Person Shooter" earlier this year which became Cole's first-ever number one hit. Check out the birthday wishes Drizzy shared for his collaborator below.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-drake-s-happy-birthday-post-for-j-cole>Drake's Happy Birthday Post For J. Cole</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Drake was mentioned in the biggest rap story of last week. Fans interpreted one of the lyrics on <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Megan Thee Stallion</a>'s new song "HISS" as being a diss at him. Despite that, he seemed to be pretty unbothered by the mention. He still hasn't made any kind of comments about the alleged diss which also takes shots at his frequent collaborator <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Nicki Minaj</a>.
