She labelled herself a “public figure representing domestic abuse”, and although Depp wasn’t mentioned by name, his legal team claims it was implied, as per <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Reuters</a>.</p><p>Depp has denied allegations of domestic abuse and testifies that the Post article was damaging to his career and reputation.</p><p>Heard is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">countersuing</a> for $100 million, stating that she told the truth and that her opinion was protected by free speech.</p><ul class=inline-links><li><strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>MORE</a></strong>: Elon Musk and Amber Heard dating timeline as CEO mentioned in Johnny Depp trial</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hitc.com/static/uploads/2022/04/GettyImages-157816250-1024x796.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=what-is-amber-heard-turd-and-me-poo>What is “Amber Heard turd” and “Me Poo”?</h2><p>“Amber Heard turd” is a nickname the internet has penned for the Aquaman actress. It first circulated in 2020 following a published photo of faecal matter in the couple’s shared bed.</p><p>Depp’s maid allegedly found faeces in the bed and the actor asserted that it couldn’t have been the doing of their small dogs, as per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">The Hollywood Reporter. </a>“It was not left by a 3- or 4-pound dog. I was convinced that it was either Ms. Heard herself or one of her cohorts involved in leaving human feces on the bed,” he said.</p><p>Now, the nickname is resurfacing as clips of Depp discussing the incident went viral.</p><p>“My initial response to that was, I mean… I laughed. It was so outside. It was so bizarre and so grotesque that I could only laugh,” he <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">told </a>the court on Thursday.</p><p>According to the actor, Heard denied the responsibility and claimed it was the dogs, but Depp <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">disagreed</a>: “They’re teacup Yorkies. They weigh about 4 pounds each. The photograph that I saw – I lived with those dogs for many years. It was not the dogs… I didn’t feel like I deserved that kind of treatment.”</p><p>Similarly, “Me Poo” is a play on the Me Too Movement, which campaigns against sexual harassment and abuse, but since images of the poop broke out, the internet has put its own spin on it.</p><p>One unknowing <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">user</a> searched for “Amber Heard turd” and literally saw the photo of poop in a bed: “Just googled “Amber Heard Turd” because I thought it was a funny rhyme & didn’t think it would actually turn up the Johnny Depp poop in the bed photo but it did. Well done internet, thank you for this bounty. Amen,” they tweeted.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter" readability=2><p>https://twitter.com/synyboi/status/1517372195793559553</p></figure><p>View Tweet</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>The Johnny Depp vs Amber Heard trial is still going to last another 4 weeks so I'm trying to reserve judgement until everything is out but MePoo and Amber Turd are trending so that's a whole thing lmao</p>— Carianne (@Zomrombone) <a href=#>April 22, 2022</a></figure><p>View Tweet</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Johnny Depp just testified the poo on the bed was bigger than their tea cup yorkies could "deliver"…🤣<a href=#>#MePoo</a></p>— OG Thor (@ThorSpirit) <a href=#>April 20, 2022</a></figure><p>View Tweet</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Johnny Depp explaining in court how an Amber Turd sized Grumpy did not come from a 4 pound Yorkie is EVERYTHING 🤣 <a href=#>#AmberTurd</a> <a href=#>#mepoo</a></p>— ItsmeRhi (@ItsmeRhi1) <a href=#>April 20, 2022</a></figure><p>View Tweet</p><h3 class=tags-title>Related Topics</h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbXTnGWcp51ksq95xptma2hiZ3xxgI5raWiZnZeys3nHnpirnF2pwrOwjg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
