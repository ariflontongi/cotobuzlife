Listen up
I'm the one, oh! Oh! Oh!Hey, girls, my name's Alaska
I got a tiny little question to ask ya
Who's that bitch that's on the top?
Oh, wait, that's me! Hey, Porkchop!
You're born naked, the rest is drag
But your face just needs a paper bag
Gimme a challenge and I'll crush you all
Changin' the game like my name's RuPaul
