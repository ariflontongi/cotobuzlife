"Gay marriage is not silly. It’s marriage — it’s marriage from people that are homosexual and it’s for them."</p><p>Rogan continued, "It’s important. They want it. They want to affirm their love and their relationship. And the fact that they’re going after that now almost makes me feel like they want us to fight. They wanna divide us in the best way they can."</p><p>"And this is the best way for them to keep pulling off all the bullshit they’re doing behind the scenes is to get us to fight over things like gay marriage or get us to fight over things like abortion or it’s just like, why are you removing freedoms?"</p><p>As the podcast host sees it, those who say that there opposed to gay marriage are also saying that there's "something wrong with being homosexual."&nbsp;</p><p>Speaking to those who have declared him a "secret conservative," Rogan lashed out, "You can suck my d*ck.&nbsp;You don’t know what the f*ck you’re talking about. I’m so far away from being a Republican."</p><p>"Just because I believe in the Second Amendment and just because I support the military and just cause I support police [doesn’t mean I’m a Republican]."</p><p>The father of two reminded listeners that he spent time on welfare as a kid. "I think having a social safety net is crucial. We should help each other," he shared. "We’re supposed to be one big community. I’m a bleeding heart liberal when it comes to a lot of shit."</p><p>Listen to the full episode of&nbsp;The Joe Rogan Experience below, and tap back in with HNHH later for more pop culture news updates.</p><p>[<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Via</a>]</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdkaH56fZZmoaidXae8qK3NZpuem5yWv6a%2FjKGgpquVobNurYybo56dlJ67qHnHnpirrF2htqOx0ZqjZpmdnrFur9Giq6KbXZi5orXMrGShnaNirm6%2BxKmsm6SZmK6vec2erqw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
