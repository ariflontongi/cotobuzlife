How is that? How did that happen? What up?”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Jenner took the direct question in stride, revealing that she and Woods “never fully cut each other off.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Jordyn and I, we always stayed in touch throughout the years and we would meet up at my house and catch up and just talk through everything,” she shared. “One day, naturally, we were like, we want to get sushi and we don’t want to hide anymore. There’s a learning lesson in everything, and I think that in a weird way, everything happens how it’s supposed to happen.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Kylie continued, “We were so attached at the hip that we needed space to grow into the people that we were supposed to be.

People live and they learn. And I forgive both parties.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57yrKjop1dn7KvusSrZKedppq%2FbrjOrKtmm5%2BjwaKv02ahqKqUrrtuw86om6xlkZvBpr6Mramiq6SWu27Ax6ikqaufo3q0r8Cnm5qkXW2BcYOTbGo%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
