Wright, who first publicly discussed being gay in 2010 and shared her personal challenges around coming out as a Christian from rural Kansas in a Huffington Post blog, was mentioned in an op-ed the Times published Thursday titled, “Look What We Made Taylor Swift Do."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Beyond Swift, the piece discusses major moments in pop culture and the political progress that has been made around the <a href=# id=auto-tag_lgbtq_1 data-tag=lgbtq>LGBTQ</a> community’s rights in the U.S. since Swift’s career began. That includes Wright coming out.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“I was mentioned in the piece, so I’ll weigh in. I think it was awful of @nytimes to publish,” <a rel=nofollow href=# data-type=link data-id=https://twitter.com/chelywright/status/1744120916714373230>Wright said in an X (formerly known as Twitter) post about the piece</a> Sunday. “Triggering for me to read— not because the writer mentioned my nearly ending my life — but seeing a public person’s sexuality being discussed is upsetting.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The piece, which comes from the same writer who in 2022 published a piece in the Times examining the <a rel=nofollow href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/27/opinion/harry-styles-identity.html>queerbaiting accusations around Harry Styles</a>, directly references an attempt Wright made on her life at 35, as well as her memoir Like Me: Confessions of a Heartland Country Singer. In it, the musician discusses the challenges LGBTQ country singers face in terms of receiving equal investment and support from the industry while also being open about their sexuality.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“Queer identity was still taboo enough in mainstream America that speaking about her love for another woman would have spelled the end of a country <a href=# id=auto-tag_music_1 data-tag=music>music</a> career. But in suppressing her identity, Ms. Wright had risked her life,” the op-ed states. “The culture in which Ms. Wright picked up that gun — the same culture in which Ms. Swift first became a star — was stunningly different from today’s<strong>.”</strong></p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">In the days since its publication, the piece has faced increasing scrutiny, with some on social media calling for its retraction in light of its open speculation about a public figure’s private life and identity. On Saturday, <a rel=nofollow href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/06/business/taylor-swift-new-york-times/index.html>CNN reported</a> that “associates” of Swift were angry about the piece.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“Because of her massive success, in this moment there is a Taylor-shaped hole in people’s ethics,” an individual who requested anonymity, told the outlet. “This article wouldn’t have been allowed to be written about Shawn Mendes or any male artist whose sexuality has been questioned by fans.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">This person added: “There seems to be no boundary some journalists won’t cross when writing about Taylor, regardless of how invasive untrue, and inappropriate it is —&nbsp;all under the protective veil of an ‘opinion piece.'”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Reps for Swift and the Times have not yet replied to The Hollywood Reporter‘s requests for comment on the Times piece.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">If you are in crisis, please call, text or chat with the Suicide and Crisis Lifeline at&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow>988</a>, or contact the Crisis Text Line by texting&nbsp;<a href=#>TALK to 741741</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue82erqxnl5q7pr7ApWSnnaeofLWt2KWmq2WjrLanwIyeqqyZqWK7psOMsqaro12ptq6x0maaoZ2crnq4vsign61lYWeAdoOXamhtcV8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
