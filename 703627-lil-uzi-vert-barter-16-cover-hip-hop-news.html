This would be huge as Barter 16 could very well be the biggest album of the year.</p><p>Yesterday, a lot of people were thinking about Young Thug. This is because <a href=# rel>it was his birthday.</a> The influential rapper turned 32 years old, and although he is locked up, we hope he got to see what people were saying about him. There was nothing but tributes for Thug on social media. In fact, <a href=# rel>even Gunna wished him a happy birthday,</a> which led to plenty of amusing reactions. As for Lil Uzi Vert, well, they wished Thugger a happy birthday by posting the cover art for Barter 16.</p><p><strong>Read More: <a href=# rel>Lil Uzi Vert And Young Thug’s Sister Get Down To “Barter 16”</a></strong></p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-lil-uzi-vert-channels-young-thug>Lil Uzi Vert Channels Young Thug</h2></span><p>As you can see up above, the cover art for the album is a 100 percent accurate recreation of the Barter 6 cover art. Uzi is even naked on the cover, which is exactly how Thug shot his cover back in the day. It was definitely a bit of a risk, but fans appreciate the realism. Moreover, Uzi revealed that the album will be dropping soon. An official date was not revealed, but fans should anticipate some sort of announcement very soon. After all, we do have the cover art.</p><p>Hopefully, we get some more details on this project, very soon. Let us know your expectations for it, in the comments section below.
