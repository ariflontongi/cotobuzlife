At the age of 4 you came home from school without your first reading book as they felt that you were not ready though many of your class mates were. You were so upset, so I brought you the same books and we read them together every night at bedtime and you came on in leaps and bounds! It was wonderful to watch.&nbsp;</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">Don't miss</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Inside Jamie and Jools Oliver's 23rd wedding anniversary at Glastonbury" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/9911b2afe1bc-jamie-jools-oliver-selfie-d.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Inside Jamie and Jools Oliver's 23rd wedding anniversary at Glastonbury" class="miniCardLink_m75k0hi hm-link" href=# rel>Inside Jamie and Jools Oliver's 23rd wedding anniversary at Glastonbury</a></h5></li></ul><p id=eBFbyBg5ddo data-wc=64>"That’s my earliest memory of your complete obsession with books, reading, and writing and thankfully it has never stopped! Pops this really is an end of an era and we can not wait to see what your next challenge and adventure brings. Thinking of all the students who have been unable to receive their degrees, not have their work marked and their grades delayed.&nbsp;</p><p id=e_wmeVDdkts data-wc=64>"With Poppy's year being the ‘Covid freshers’ they really deserve better that being the understatement!!! So much sweat and tears literally went in to Pop finishing her dissertation and final exams. Hours and hours spent in the library most days till midnight! They all deserve to be acknowledged and they deserve to get their degree and celebrate their graduation.
