He tries to ACT like he so ‘Playa’ to the public but really he’s a hurt [a*s] little boy….that desperately needs help,” she added before leaping into the allegations of abuse. “He put his hands on me Monday because he don’t know how to have grown up conversations & I STILL ain’t call the cops or inform the hotel.

Jinsui’s decision to address Key Glock’s claims about the police were prompted by a tweet he sent out on Tuesday. “ion respect nobody who play police games [thumbs down emoji],” he wrote. In a follow up, he continued to throw shots at her, writing, “She might look good on IG but I SWEAR dat bitch AINT NONE!!”</p><p>Jinsui also said that Key Glock failed to show emotional maturity and hoped that the materialistic goods would keep her around. “I did my best with tryna understand him but he ain’t a ready to be a man & he’s not a good person. It works for his rapper image. Not his personal affairs. He’ll learn one day…but not with me! Lol,” she wrote.
