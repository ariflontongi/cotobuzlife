According to court docs obtained by <a href=#>TMZ</a>,&nbsp;the drummer sued the hospital that treated him for blood clots, alleging that a doctor had used a dirty needle while sedating him prior to an MRI, which resulted in a staph infection. Barker was then unable to play with his band, Blink-182, for several shows, leading to the cancellation some shows entirely that fall and delaying the start of Blink's residency in Las Vegas.</p><p>Though Barker hasn't updated fans on the status of his lawsuit since, in the summer of 2022, he did have another serious health scare following a routine endoscopy, which resulted in severe abdominal pain and a hospitalization. Per <a href=#>NBC 4</a>, Barker later shared on his Instagram story, "During the endoscopy, I had a very small polyp removed right in a very sensitive area, usually handled by specialists, which unfortunately damaged a critical pancreatic drainage tube. This resulted in severe life threatening pancreatitis." Thankfully, Barker's condition improved, and he was able to return home a few days later.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamllZoJxhI6cnKWdkqh6uLTOZp%2BanF2isqW1wpqjZqWZqLWivNJo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
