They made their red carpet debut as a couple at the 2023 BET Awards. By August of the same year, cheating accusations began swirling online and the two seemingly split. However, in November, Meech made a remark about his girl being pregnant which many fans took to mean Walker. He later clarified on The Morning Hustle that the comments were taken out of context. “No, I don’t got no baby [on the way],” Meech explained. “…Yeah I was playing on that video… They took a video of me playing around and made it into something. It wasn’t something.”</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-lil-meech-discusses-summer-walker-relationship>Lil Meech Discusses Summer Walker Relationship</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Check out Meech's latest comments on his relationship with Walker above.
