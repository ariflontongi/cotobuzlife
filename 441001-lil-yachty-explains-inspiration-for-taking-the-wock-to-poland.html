Most recently, the rappers leaked track "Poland" (which boasts the now iconic, warbly, high-pitched chorus of "I took the wock to Poland) has become a social media sensation. Amid a <a href=# rel>cosign from Drake</a> and even an <a href=# rel>invite from the Polish Prime Minister</a>, many fans are befuddled at how such a silly-sounding song became the hit that it is, and Lil Boat's come through with some verified artist input.</p><p>Michael Loccisano/Getty Images</p><p>The Atlanta rapper was invited to appear on the popular YouTube reaction channel ZIAS!, hosted by Zias and B. Lou, to react to the Cole Bennet-directed music video for "Poland" on Lyrical Lemonade. The million dollar question was asked: how did this song come together? How did you take the wock to Poland?</p><p>"I’ma tell y’all the truth," the 25-year-old began. "I was in the studio, right, working on my new album, and I was actually just trolling. My mans was just drinking a Poland Springs water bottle.”</p><p>"Is that how it happened?" B. Lou asked.</p><p>"Yeah," he replied with a smile, "I mean obviously I had some wock, but he had a Poland Springs water bottle.” Yachty himself was surprised at the track's success.</p><p>“I was like, ‘Damn.’ And the song was a joke! I was just trolling. It leaked, and that’s why I was like, technically it’s not finished. It’s just a verse. I never finished the song, but it went crazy. So I was like, ‘Shit, I might as well put it out.’”</p><p>That's how a leaked troll move turned into a hit music video and TikTok audio. It's uncommon in the industry to see artists embrace a leak and refuse to hold a song out, but Yachty said that's the way he rolls. He was also inevitably asked if he has ever, in fact, taken the wock to Poland.</p><p>"Nah, but now I got to," he replied. We'll see what impact this virality will have on The Boat's upcoming album, which <a href=# rel>he's said will be more "alternative" than rap.</a></p><p>You can check out Zias and B.
