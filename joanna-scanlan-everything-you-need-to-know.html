Which you could take in two ways. But I think what they meant, their unfulfilled artistic expression perhaps was curtailed by having a family, and perhaps I wouldn't have been able to manage both. My deep suspicion is that I would have prioritised children above having an artistic life."</p><p id=eGOGGemAgevt data-wc=15></p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
