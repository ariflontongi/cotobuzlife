The following year, she snagged her breakout role on "One Day at a Time," playing Barbara Cooper. She filmed a whopping 214 episodes, per <a href=#>IMDb</a>. The series would also earn her a huge fanbase, plus <a href=#>three Golden Globe nominations</a>, including two consecutive wins for Best Supporting Actress in 1981 and 1982.</p><p dir=ltr>Following her early successes, Bertinelli continued to act steadily through the '80s and '90s. In 2010, she got the lead in "Hot in Cleveland," which, as <a href=#>Entertainment Weekly</a> reported at the time, broke records for TV Land when it made its debut.&nbsp;In 2012, she got a star on the&nbsp;<a href=#>Hollywood Walk of Fame</a>, but after "Hot in Cleveland" went off the air in 2015, she decided to pursue passions outside of acting. However, in 2022, she made a surprise announcement: She's back acting. Bertinelli revealed on&nbsp;<a href=#>Instagram</a>&nbsp;that she and "Modern Family" star Ariel Winter were filming a pilot for a show called "Hungry."</p><p dir=ltr>While we can't say for certain how much her long-running acting career has made her, it feels safe to assume it's been good to her bank account. According to <a href=#>Celebrity Net Worth</a>, her "Hot in Cleveland" costar Betty White was reportedly paid $75,000 an episode, so do with that information what you will.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmcWplaoFxe8eeqZ6rXZ28uHnMrpqhZaaWuaa%2ByJ5km52iqbavsculoGaho2K%2Fpq3LpbBmr5%2Bnwal7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
