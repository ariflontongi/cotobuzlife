In 2011 the now-famous clip in which he joked about leaving a scooter outside the dairy ("nek minnit" he found his scooter in pieces) was uploaded to YouTube.</p><p>By the end of the year, the clip had been viewed 1.6 million times and "nek minnit" was New Zealand's sixth-most-searched term on Google. As Hawken told <a href=#>Canvas magazine</a>, it didn't stop there.</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p>"I've met so many people and it's made a lot of people happy. But you know what it's like, you see famous people and you think they're happy and they're not."</p><p>In the Loading Docs short documentary MEME Me, Hawken goes back to the beginning, confronting the video that started it all and the price it had on a young skateboarder and artist living with a rare genetic condition.</p><p>Only one in 7000 people worldwide have Ectodermal Dysplasia, which affects sufferers' physical appearance.</p><p>Hawken has hardly any sweat glands, so his skin looks discoloured. Thanks to the disorder, he has also lost his hair and his teeth are crooked.</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p>As the clip was exchanged around the world, internet users with no knowledge of his medical background speculated carelessly and often cruelly about his appearance. Some thought he had leukaemia, others claimed he was "retarded" or had a meth problem.</p><p>Hawken had already been bullied about his appearance at school and having to deal with that on a global stage was hurtful.</p><p>The other problem, as he told Canvas, was that he lost control of a reputation built up over two decades of absolute dedication to his craft of skateboarding.</p><p>"It was upsetting. It wasn't so much that it was out of my control, it was that all these other people were controlling it and using it. I was really worried about what I was going to have my persona and my credibility assigned to."</p><h2 class="related-articles__heading section-entertainment">Related articles</h2><p>Hawken has accepted a number of commercial jobs that play on the meme, including NZTA's Dilemmas drink-drive ad, in which he is referred to as "The Nek Minnit". He owns the relevant trademarks, "not so much so I can do things with it but just actually for my own protection. I've just had to focus on who I am and going back to what I do."</p><p>The documentary is directed by Hawken's old friend Stjohn Milgrew, who has been photographing Hawken and his friends since they were teenagers together in Aotea Square.</p><p>MEME Me is part of the 2019 Loading Docs collection and can be viewed online via <a href=#>nzherald.co.nz/loadingdocs</a> and <a href=#>www.loadingdocs.net</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r8bHnqmapJRjsLB6zbNmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTEosDCoWSmnZ2aeq6xjKecpGWdnruvtdNmpJqmXaGyt7WMoZiwo5WjeqWx0pypopqVqHqpu9Zmq6GdXau2s63LZq2inJWkeqS0wKeenpxdnba0ecuinZ5nfX6UgpembYlwfXGHk5WBppN5b45ldpySk5No</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
