She said, "I waited until I had the means and that made all the difference," while citing the recent overturning of Roe v. Wade, which gave constitutional access to safe and legal abortion across the US, adding, "The choice to have a child - by yourself, on your own terms - it was the best part of my life.. It's the thing that I hope women feel confident doing by themselves."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sLrMmqWoqpGirm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGSyr8DEq6uaoZ6isq%2FAjKecsKtfZ31zfo5pb2hpYGS6qrrDsmSkmZyeu6h5wJyrq52jqHq1tMRmpp%2BemZiybq%2FArKtmm5ieuaW%2BxKdkqZmkmr%2BvsdGiq7JmmKm6rQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
