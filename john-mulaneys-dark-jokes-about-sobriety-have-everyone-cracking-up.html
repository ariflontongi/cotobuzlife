"In December of 2020, I went to dinner at a friend's apartment," he said in the opening. "But it was not dinner. It was an intervention. For me. My least favorite kind of intervention." Mulaney then took the joke a bit further. "Do you know how big of a drug problem you have to have if you open a door and see people gathered, and your first thought is, 'This is probably an intervention about my drug problem?'" he said.</p><p dir=ltr>In addition, the comedian told a story about his time in rehab when he sat down with a counselor and had to delete his drug dealer from his phone. Mulaney explained that he told the drug dealer he was blocking him in a nice way. "But I'm really polite, so I didn't know how to end the text, so I said, 'But thank you, for all the nights that became days and your inspired professionalism,'" he joked.</p><p dir=ltr>Mulaney has been pretty open and honest with his struggles with drugs and alcohol. According to <a href=#>Vulture</a>, the star went to a 60-day rehab program where he reportedly did well.&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr>If you or anyone you know is struggling with addiction issues, help is available.
