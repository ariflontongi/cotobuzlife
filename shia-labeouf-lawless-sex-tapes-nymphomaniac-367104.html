Entertainment’s Chelsea Lately. (Watch video of the interview below.)</p><p><a href=#><strong>PHOTOS: ‘Lawless’ Stars Suit Up for the Big Time</strong></a></p><p>It’s unclear whether LaBeouf, who is dating stylist <strong>Karolyn Pho,</strong> was joking, but he’s previously said the sex scenes in the erotic two-part drama <a href=#>will be the real deal.</a></p><p>“[The movie] is what you think it is,” LaBeouf recently told MTV News. “It is Lars von Trier, making a movie about what he’s making. For instance, there’s a disclaimer at the top of the script that basically says we’re doing it for real. Everything that is illegal, we’ll shoot in blurred images. Other than that, everything is happening.”</p><p>Nymphomaniac, which marks Von Trier’s first film since 2011’s Melancholia, will chronicle the sexual adventures of a woman (<strong>Charlotte Gainsbourg</strong>) from her youth through age 50. <strong>Stellan Skarsgard</strong> plays her husband, and <strong>Nicole Kidman</strong> has suggested she might have a small role in the film, which goes into production next month.</p><p>As for why he wanted the part, LaBeouf told Handler: “I don’t know what it’s gonna be until I get out there. I know he’s a very dangerous director, I know we’re trying to do something different. It’s not your typical film. It’s about what it’s about.”</p><p><strong><a href=#>PHOTOS: Shia LaBeouf, Jessica Chastain Celebrate at ‘Lawless’ Screening in New York</a></strong></p><p>LaBeouf, who recently <a href=#>went full-frontal</a> for an artsy Sigur Ros music video, made his sex-tape revelation on the heels of a USA Today interview in which he said he dropped acid to prepare for a key scene in his upcoming crime comedy The Necessary Death of Charlie Countryman, which is in preproduction.</p><p>“There’s a way to do an acid trip like Harold & Kumar, and there’s a way to be on acid,” LaBeouf said. “What I know of acting, <strong>Sean Penn</strong> actually strapped up to that (electric) chair in Dead Man Walking. These are the guys that I look up to.”</p><p>LeBeouf also has said he was high one day on the set of Charlie Countryman, slated to be released at Sundance next year.</p><p>And, as <a href=# rel=nofollow>The Hollywood Reporter </a>previously <a href=#>reported</a>, LaBeouf, best known for his roles in the Transformers movies and the latest Indiana Jones installment, has traded standard studio fare for indie films.</p><p><a href=#><strong>STORY: Shia LaBeouf and Jessica Chastain Talk Unfiltered at ‘Lawless’ NYC Premiere</strong></a></p><p>“I’m done,” he declared. “There’s no room for being a visionary in the studio system. It literally cannot exist. You give <strong>Terrence Malick</strong> a movie like Transformers, and he’s f—ed. There’s no way for him to exist in that world.”</p><p>Talking about the indie film world, LeBeouf added: “These dudes are a miracle. They give you the money, and they trust you — [unlike the studios, which] give you the money, then get on a plane and come to the set and stick a finger up your ass and chase you around for five months.”</p><p>Lawless, a bootlegging drama set in Depression-era Virginia, also stars <strong>Gary Oldman, Tom Hardy, Guy Pearce, Jessica Chastain </strong>and Mia Wasikowska. The movie hit theaters Wednesday.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue82erqxnl5q7pr7ApWSnnaeofLS0yJpkpZmSmry2soylmLCklajAbr%2FEsWStmaCawG662KanoaedlruqrcJmam9vYWWBcA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
