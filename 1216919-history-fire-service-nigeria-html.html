You should remember that we got our full independence from Britain in 1960, and three years later the government released the special Fire Service Act that officially penned the existence of our own independent Nigerian Fire Service.</p><p class=align-left>It is necessary to note that those people who worked for the Lagos Police Fire Brigade were automatically transferred to the newly established Fire Service under the Ministry of Internal Affairs.</p><p class=align-left>The Federal Fire Service main functions:</p><ul><li>Fire fighting</li><li>Rescue service</li><li>Fire prevention</li><li>Search service</li><li>Humanitarian help</li><li>Other fire-related services</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/7425e20d275b8ab7.jpg><p class=align-left>Photo: www.independent.ng</p><p class=align-left>The history of Federal Fire Service in Nigeria includes the creation of a number of fire stations all across the country. All officers and other staff who is working at the fire departments these days are referred to as paramilitary workers.</p><p class=align-left>The history of Federal Fire Service in Nigeria continues today. It is believed that the organization has many challenges (lack of equipment, capacity, bad infrastructure, etc.) that are yet to be overcome.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/4b1a34c91c47113b.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Facts you need to know about Nigerian Prison Service ranks</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The country is working on fixing all the problems. For example, in 2017, according to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">informationng.com</a>, the Nigeria fire service received 25 brand new fire trucks along with water tenders which is great because this was the first car garage upgrade since 1901. Hopefully, such tradition will continue, and most issues will be solved eventually.</p><p class=align-left><strong>P.S. </strong>Now you know when did the fire service start in Nigeria and how it used to be a small unit in the British colony that grew into a big Federal Fire Service with the independence of our country.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> Federal Fire Service salary structure</p><p></p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkfnN9lXJocmWYnsC1u9GyZJ%2Bhopp6tLHRr6CcnV2jtqix0aKYZ6Ckork%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
