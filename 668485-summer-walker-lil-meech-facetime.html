Moreover, <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Summer Walker</a> seemingly posted a screenshot of producer Jay Versace's Instagram page with the caption "@jay get on my nerves lol." However, what most fans noticed is that Lil Meech was in the corner of the screenshot, apparently on a FaceTime call with Summer. Not only that, but the R&B star quickly deleted the post and put up another story with the caption, "Oh wow I'm slow as f**k." Given that Meech wrote that "Summer is [his]," people are even more prone to take any hint they can get that they're together.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Still, Summer Walker has a lot to look forward to as far as upcoming releases, so she probably knows what she's doing. During her performance at this year's Dreamville Festival, she confirmed that her next project, the <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Clear 2: Soft Life</a> EP, will release on May 19. While this is far from the first hint we've gotten of their potential fling, a new music release puts all that conversation into context. Still, nothing official as of yet, and maybe she wants us to listen to the EP for answers.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-summer-walker-seemingly-facetimes-with-lil-meech>Summer Walker Seemingly FaceTimes With Lil Meech</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Regardless, fans are incredibly excited for the 27-year-old's first solo project since 2021's album Still Over It. Unfortunately, Summer Walker's personal journey also faced some hate online, but <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">she brushed it off gracefully</a>. "27 w 3 kids. Sounds like you rich in misery to me," one user commented under her post <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">celebrating her 27th birthday</a>. "I would literally be SO sad if I ain’t have 3 kids right now,” the "Playing Games" singer clapped back. “Once I sign some more checks Ima have more."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Meanwhile, Walker wasn't the only half of this couple to celebrate a recent birthday. <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>50 Cent</a> took to Instagram to <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">congratulate Lil Meech on his 23rd</a>. If this is all for show, then hats off to Summer Walker for a great promotional rollout. However, Meech's enthusiasm suggests that there really is something deeper there, and fans want to know. On that note, come back to HNHH for the latest news and updates on Summer Walker and Lil Meech.</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Gabriel Bras Nevares is a music and pop culture news writer for HotNewHipHop.
