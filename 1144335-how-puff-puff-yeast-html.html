The amount of oil should be enough to cover an egg. The quantity is necessary to receive ball puff puff, not flat pieces. However, if you don’t mind the shape, you can use less oil. Heat the oil up eventually until the oil is about 375 degrees.</li><li>In a separate bowl, mix the flour, sugar, and spices. You are free to add whatever you like but remember that the authentic African puff puff was made without vanilla or butter-cream flavors.</li><li>Take another bowl and whip the egg thoroughly with the help of a mixer. Then, add water and beer (or soda). Mix everything in a very thorough way, so that the liquid is completely even but rather thick.</li><li>Combine the dry and liquid ingredients and mix them thoroughly. Make sure the mass is smooth and can be taken by a spoon. Now, you can take pieces of the dough with your hands, roll gently and drop into the heated up oil or use two spoons. One of them is meant to take the dough while the other helps the dough to form a ball and fall into the oil.</li><li>Fry for several minutes up to the golden brown color. It’s a good idea to fry only a few balls at a time. Even though it’s oil, balls should have no chance to stick together. You’ll spend few time if you fry them all in a couple of portions.</li><li>Use a simmer spoon to take them out of the heated oil. Don’t hurry and let the extra oil drop off the spoon. Then, place the puff puff onto a paper towel and let it absorb the oil from the surface.</li><li>While the puff puff balls are still hot, roll them in cinnamon sugar (it’s an optional step, which depends on how sweet you want them to be or whether you like cinnamon). Another option that you can take is dipping the balls into some sugar syrup or icing, or even chocolate but it’s the matter of your own preference.</li><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt3e601bcfru9.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>The simplest recipe of plantain mosa ever</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Serve the puff puff while the balls are still warm.
