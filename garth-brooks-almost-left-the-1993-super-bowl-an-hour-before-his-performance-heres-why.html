So that muscle was being used, but she had it innate." Decades later, the performance is still absolutely spellbinding to listen to, a highlight of Houston's remarkable legacy. Two years later, Garth Brooks lent his own dulcet tones to "The Star-Spangled Banner," another momentous performance. This one, however, became memorable for a very different reason: Brooks, after a dispute with organizers, went to leave the stadium and had to be convinced to return and perform in short order.</p><p dir=ltr>The year before, Brooks released the song "We Shall Be Free" about inequality and unfairness.&nbsp;Per <a href=#>Whiskey Riff</a>,&nbsp;the song was written&nbsp;by Stephanie Davis, and it was one of Brooks' favorites. As he himself put it in the materials for his album "The Hits" (via Whiskey Riff), he considers it "easily the most controversial song I have ever done. A song of love, a song of tolerance ... I never thought there would be any problems with this song."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB9kHFvam9oZLSivtOhZJuqn6S4tHnApaSoq6Riuaay02aroZ1dZoZ6f4ysrKmdomKvsMPLZpinZZikwrN5wZ6dqKqVYrWqv4ypnKuen6e6orrCnmShnaKawG7Dx7Jm</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
