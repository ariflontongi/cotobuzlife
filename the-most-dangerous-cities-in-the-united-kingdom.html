Unlike other notably dangerous cities, however, Leeds enjoys relatively high levels of wealth. In fact, in 2015, the city was named the wealthiest city in the north of England, according to the <a href=#>Yorkshire Post</a>. However, some neighborhoods in Leeds remain troubled, with Armley,&nbsp;Burmantofts and Richmond, and&nbsp;Killingbeck and Seacroft among the most deprived, <a href=#>Leeds Live</a> reports.&nbsp;</p><p>Some of the most shocking violence in Leeds is caused by the city's underworld. In August 2018, 24-year-old&nbsp;Christopher Lewis was shot dead on his mother's doorstep in what <a href=#>Leeds Live</a> reported as a gangland execution. 15 months prior, in January 2017, 19-year-old Raheem Wilks was shot dead outside of a barber shop in the Harehills neighborhood. The gunman fired several times, striking a bystander's car and almost hitting an 8-year-old girl.&nbsp;</p><p>These killings continued a trend of violent and sometimes <a href=#>mysterious crimes</a> in the northern city. For example, in June 2008, 20-year-old Adam Chadwick answered a knock at the door and was met by a woman asking for "Michelle." Chadwick told the woman that she had the wrong house and closed the door. Minutes later, the woman returned with three masked men who barged into Chadwick's property and shot him at point blank range, inflicting a fatal head injury from which he died two days later. The inexplicable crime remains unsolved.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunCEkmltbmpfqbWmecyoqq1llJa7qLHRqKysZZOewaqx0magp2WknbJuwc2iq56cXaC2r7PDqKRo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
