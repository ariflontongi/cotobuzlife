The motor spins at 125,000rpm and features a triple diffuser to help reduce any turbulence and noise, too.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YjPkteHkmJsqUJBDhMD5mA-1920-80.jpg><p><strong>IT BOASTS A BIGGER BIN</strong></p><p>It stands to reason that a machine that is designed to vacuum more square footage needs to have a larger bin to avoid having to empty it repeatedly. The new V11 Outsize has just that, with a bin measuring a whopping 150% bigger than the Dyson V11 Absolute cord-free vacuum.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>THE FILTRATION SYSTEM IS SECOND TO NONE</strong></p><p>Dust and allergens have met their match with the Dyson V11 Outsize. The machine features a fully sealed filtration system that captures up to 99.97% of particles while vacuuming, then expels clean air out again.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>THE LCD SCREEN GIVES YOU COMPLETE CONTROL</strong></p><p>The handy LCD screen on the handle displays the machine's selected power mode and remaining runtime, giving you complete control. Reminders will pop up whenever the filters need cleaning and it'll notify you of any blockages (and how to clear them, too).</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uEYzuaPVhJsyfMD7UpzD7C-1920-80.jpg><p><strong>IT COMES WITH BIGGER AND BETTER CLEANING TOOLS</strong></p><p>The V11 Outsize comes with a high torque cleaner head and four separate tools, making it easy to use whether you're <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.homesandgardens.com/buying-guides/best-vacuum-for-pet-hair>cleaning your sofa of pet hair</a>, clearing your carpet of crumbs or dusting away cobwebs from the ceiling.&nbsp;</p><p>The high torque cleaner head features special sensors that detect any brush bar resistance, automatically adjusting the suction power when it moves between floor types for optimal performance.&nbsp;</p><p>It is also 25% wider than the Dyson V11 cordless vacuum cleaner, measuring 32cm&nbsp;in width so you can cover more floor space in each sweep.</p><p><strong>EACH BATTERY LASTS UP TO 60 MINUTES</strong></p><p>The battery pack on V11 Outsize offers up to 60 minutes of run time - just enough to whizz around every room in your home, quickly and easily. What's more, each model comes with two interchangeable battery packs, so if you do run out of power mid-clean, simply swap over the batteries to finish the job.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eyFJbNpGfEUdL8bfjhPEMA-1920-80.jpg><p>Available to buy now, the Dyson V11 Outsize is priced at $799 in the US and £649.99 in the UK.</p><p><strong>CHECK OUT THE ENTIRE DYSON V11 FAMILY OF VACUUM CLEANERS HERE</strong></p><p>Dyson V11 deals</p><p><span class=hawk-load-more-load-more>Show More Deals</span></p><p><strong>BROWSE THE LATEST DYSON CORDLESS DEALS HERE</strong></p><p>Dyson cordless deals</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvMnqqappScrrOwxKeqZ5ufonyvsdasZqedp2Kxur%2FOp2Scp6KZuaa%2F0majmq2emLU%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
