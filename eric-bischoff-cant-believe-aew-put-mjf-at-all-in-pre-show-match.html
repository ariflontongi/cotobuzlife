Maxwell is now the AEW World Champion and he never fails to carry himself like a champion every week. MJF is tag partners with Adam Cole and has been trying to be very chummy with him. Now it appears Eric Bischoff can’t believe AEW put MJF in the pre-show at AEW All In.</p><p>It was officially confirmed during this week’s episode of AEW Dynamite that MJF and Adam Cole will be challenging <a href=#>Aussie Open for the ROH World Tag Team Championships in the Zero Hour of AEW All In</a>.</p><p>While speaking on the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">83 Weeks</a> podcast, Eric Bischoff talked about AEW’s decision to put MJF in the pre-show at All In, making it clear that he couldn’t believe AEW would do such a thing.</p><p>“I saw the clip of MJF’s promo and I think the world of MJF. I think he’s the most important talent on that show and I think he’s the most important part of the future of AEW. He is without question, the most entertaining character on that show. I don’t care about anybody else’s opinion. If you think differently than me, you’re not thinking at all. You’re reacting emotionally because you are a fanboy. Listen, MJF is the most valuable man on that roster and to put him on the pre-game show?! That’s the silliest damn thing I’ve ever heard. Whoever came up with that idea should be beaten.”</p><p>We will have to wait and see whether MJF and Adam Cole will be able to defeat Aussie Open for the ROH Tag Team Championships at the AEW All In pay-per-view, as that might make fans happy.</p><p>What’s your view on what Eric Bishoff said?
