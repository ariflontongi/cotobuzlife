She claimed she met the former Whitney&nbsp;star on Instagram in September 2014 before taking their conversation over to the social media platform Snapchat. Doe's lawsuit&nbsp;<a href=# rel>followed a string of sexual misconduct allegations against D'Elia</a>&nbsp;from the year prior.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/urbanlinx.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/userfiles/20/98/239820_5f364ced59a38298045112cc01ace1bc.jpg><p><h6>Kevin Winter/Getty Images</h6></p><p><span>Doe claimed D’Elia solicited over 100 sexually explicit photos and videos of herself, half of which were taken when she was only 17 and he was 34.

Chris D’Elia abused his status and fame to lure me in, take advantage, and manipulate me when I was at a vulnerable age.”</span></p><p><span>Chris D'Elia took a hiatus from his podcast and social media when the allegations were first surfacing, however he finally returned in February and admitted that sex was controlling his life, which you can check <a href=# rel>here</a>.</span></p><p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">[via]</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdja353gpBmmqGqmah6pbHLophmm5ieuaV5z6ipp2WRmLC2v8SrZJ2qn6XAbq3LpWScoJGntKa%2FjJqemqGeqMFutMimZKudoKS%2FtXnNnq6s</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
