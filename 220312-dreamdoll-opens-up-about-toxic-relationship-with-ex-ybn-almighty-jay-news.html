At the 13:20 mark of the video, BLovesLife asks DreamDoll if she's "still with the same guy," pointing out how playful&nbsp;the two of them&nbsp;would always be together.&nbsp;DreamDoll&nbsp;indicates that they've been broken up for four months, but that she "never spoke about it."&nbsp;Vowing to be honest, she&nbsp;explains:&nbsp;“I just deserve better and I know my worth. I know how I should be treated. I know men are not supposed to put their hands on women and…that’s just that." This almost direct assertion that YBN Almighty Jay was physically abusive to her is&nbsp;super alarming and upsetting, and&nbsp;it's a relief that she got out of the situation when she did.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">DreamDoll doesn't address the alleged domestic abuse after this statement,&nbsp;instead describing how he&nbsp;became a distraction to her career. "I’m trying to focus on my music, and that's basically what I've been doing. I feel like when you’re in a relationship, especially being an artist, sometimes it&nbsp;kind of&nbsp;zones you out and you forget sometimes. You'll put being with your&nbsp;boyfriend over your studio sessions, and then that's when you start arguing with your manager, you're canceling shows because of that. I was kind of like losing my focus a lot." However, she says that now, she has regained that focus. "Now, I feel like superwoman. I cannot wait to drop all my new music. My fans are ready. My supporters are ready. I'm ready and now I'm signed to a multi-million dollar label. At the end of the day, so much better things came on my plate when you let go of toxic stuff."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdiZ310fZFmm6udkaKxsLjLZqapnZ6oera8jJqZqK2kYsGwxMicZKudnJbBqrvNrJ%2BiqF2strW0jJ6vZrGSo3qiuMyinqGsqWK3osWMp5ywqw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
