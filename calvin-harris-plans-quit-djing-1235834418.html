The music producer-songwriter, who turned 40 in January, shared in a recent interview with U.K. radio station Capital Dance that he will likely stop DJing in approximately 10 years. “I always said that once I get past 50, I can’t see me DJing, man,” the “This Is What You Came For” artist said. But host MistaJam was quick to point out that British DJ Carl Cox is still active, doing live performances at age 61."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

On the more commercial end, it gets a wee bit… a little bit suspect,” Harris quipped.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Though Harris has brought his music all around the world, headlining some of the biggest festivals including Coachella, he shared that once he moves away from DJing, he wants to turn his focus to the studio.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“I think I’d prefer to be in the studio making tunes, like ghost producers,” he explained. “I think that’s where the majority of my talent lies, is making songs sound good. So, I would like to make other people’s records sound good.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The “Feel So Close” artist added that there’s still some time for fans to enjoy his live sets, but he also wants to start the transition to producing for other artists in a few years. “42, 43 —&nbsp;something like that,” he noted.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Harris rose to stardom following the release of his first album&nbsp;I Created Disco&nbsp;in 2007. Not only has he released his own music that’s reached the top 10 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, but he has also collaborated with several artists, including Rihanna, Ellie Goulding, Ne-Yo, Dua Lipa and more.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">His song “We Found Love” with Rihanna was No. 1 for 10 weeks, and “This Is What You Came For” and “Summer” peaked in the top 10.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Earlier in the interview, Harris said that while he “feels good” going into this new decade of life, he wasn’t necessarily thrilled about it. “I think in the run-up to it, you’re googling anti-aging supplements,” he joked. “You know, my missus [wife Vick Hope], she’s got so much energy. I’m trying to keep up with her.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue82erqxnnarAqq%2BMp5ywq1%2BYrq3CyKdkoZmip7a0ec%2BlmKerXabCqsCMnaGippdifnN%2FlHFqbWxhbXw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
