According to<a href=#>&nbsp;Observer</a>&nbsp;in 2014, Close was one of New York City's richest artists and continued to have demand for his "massive gridded mixed-media portraits" decades into his career. At that time, his prints regularly sold for as much as $100,000. He also snagged an impressive $4.8 million sale at Sotheby's New York in 2005. His art was also featured in some of the most prestigious galleries in the world, including the Tate Modern in London and the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris.</p><p>However, despite the continued success in his later years, Close faced allegations of sexual harassment. In 2017, <a href=#>The New York Times</a> reported that multiple women alleged that Close sexually harassed them when they posed for him at his studio. The artist told the New York Times, "If I embarrassed anyone or made them feel uncomfortable, I am truly sorry, I didn't mean to. I acknowledge having a dirty mouth, but we're all adults." <a href=#>NPR</a> reported that Close was diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia in 2015 and noted that Close's neurologist said the condition "could have accounted for some of his behavior." No charges seem to have been filed, but the National Gallery of Art did cancel an exhibition of Close's work because of the allegations.</p><p>If you or anyone you know has been a victim of sexual assault, help is available.
