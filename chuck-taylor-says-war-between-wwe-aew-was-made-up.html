While speaking to the AEW Unrestricted podcast, Chuckie T opened up about the Wednesday Night War. He was a groomsman at Johnny Gargano and Candice LeRae’s wedding. He has legit friends on the NXT roster.
Taylor said that the feud between the two companies is “fake bullsh*t.” He wants to see them succeed, but not at the expense of AEW."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

But they [members of the&nbsp;NXT&nbsp;roster] are all my friends. Like, common, I was actually a groomsman in Johnny Gargano’s wedding. I want them to succeed, too. Obviously, not at our expense, I hope they lose and die forever, but those are all my friends. Pretty much everyone on&nbsp;NXT&nbsp;TV I know pretty well,”</p><p>AEW and WWE continue to take little jabs at each other, but that might just be the nature of the beast. If they don’t acknowledge the rivalry then that might let things die out. Some of the popularity of NXT and AEW Dynamite could be contributed to the Wednesday Night War itself. We’ll have to see how things develop from this point on.</p><p>Thanks to <a href=#>Wrestling Inc</a> for the quote</p><p>September 21, 2020 8:50 am</p><span class=author-name>Felix Upton</span> <span></span><p>Felix Upton is a seasoned writer with over 30 years of experience.
