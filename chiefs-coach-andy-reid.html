Speaking during a recent appearance on the podcast Scoop City, Coach Reid explained why he thinks their love story works.
&#34;I think it's great for him,&#34; he told hosts Chase Daniel and Dianna Russini. &#34;He can handle itâ€”as a matter of fact I think he probably loves it, to a point."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

"He can handle itâ€”as a matter of fact I think he probably loves it, to a point. I think there's a great escape for him."</p><p>Reid continued, "I said that about Taylor, too, I mean she comes to the game, she can kind of escape having to be the show. And Travis can do that, and when he goes to her concerts, she's the star, and he can be hanging out and be the support or the waterboy, so he can do that."</p><p>Kelce is often spotted enjoying himself with various celebs at Eras Tour shows, and not being the center of attention. He changed that somewhat when he appeared on stage during one of his girlfriend's dates in London, but even then, he was still very much a background actor.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hj922wUmTsrpNCwSgSiJmY-1920-80.jpg><p>Likewise, for all the cameras trained on her, when Swift attends Chiefs games she's obviously not the main event (well, you know, except <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/celebrity-adele-praises-taylor-swift-football-watchable/>where the Swifties present are concerned</a>).</p><p>On the podcast, Reid further described the personality traits that mean Kelce is particularly well suited for the fame that has come with his romantic relationship.</p><p class=newsletter-form__strapline>Marie Claire email subscribers get intel on fashion and beauty trends, hot-off-the-press celebrity news, and more.

"And he's an outgoing guy, I mean, he comes into a room, he's gonna light the room up. Everybody's his best friend. Until you prove him wrong, everybody's his best friend, and so, he can handle it."</p><p>Of course, Coach Reid is often asked about Tayvis in interviews, so it's not the first time he's spoken on it. In February, <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/celebrity-kansas-city-chiefs-coach-andy-reid-taylor-swift-loves-game-kelce/>he told SiriusXM NFL Radio</a> that Swift "loves the game, and obviously loves Kelce." (Unclear whether he meant to imperfectly quote "Blank Space" lyrics.)</p><p>Cute!</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Andy Reid has high praise for @tkelce and @taylorswift13 ðŸŒŸHear more at: https://t.co/fyn1uoWl8C pic.twitter.com/M1L8oLEMvo<a href=# data-url=https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1756432612342874197 referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>February 10, 2024</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3RopycpJGev6Z6wqikaJuVobKjvsitsGibmJ6yp7%2BMnKaam5hirq%2Bw2GapnqGUZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
