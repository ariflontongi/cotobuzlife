Then, we return to the Lodge on foot, taking in the wonderful natural surroundings.</p><p id=ePu3RI9BfT_1 data-wc=72>"Back at the Lodge, there’s the option of sailing, paddle boarding or canoeing on the Loch if guests are up to it. Then, after a freshen up, the evening starts with either a local whisky or gin tasting session – followed by a wonderful dinner prepared by Chef James and served in the elegant dining room or the Argentinian Grill room.&nbsp; After dinner, the lights go down and the music goes up!"</p><p id=eCF6_QIgk-nA data-wc=23><strong>Make sure you never miss a ROYAL story! <a class=hm-link href=#>Sign up to our newsletter</a> to get all of our celebrity, royal and lifestyle news delivered directly to your inbox.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfnbyusdJoaWlqY2V%2FcoKQb2tua2Nkvaq8z5pkpqGUmbmmwM6nZKaZpKm1psPSZp2apZmhxm680ainnqqkrnqouMSnZJqelqe2pHnErKuarJVk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
