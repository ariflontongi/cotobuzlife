Mother to our dog Bruno." The athletic beauty and Rory parted ways after three years together because the groom-to-be was not ready for marriage.

He presented caroline with a cushion-cut diamond ring, which is estimated to have cost the golfer in excess of £125,000. Shortly after the proposal, Caroline showed off the stunner in a photo uploaded on Twitter. It is not yet known what Caroline will do with the ring, but Rory has reportedly indicated that he <strong>wants his ex-fiancée to keep the piece of jewellery</strong>. "They were together nearly three years and that time meant a lot to him so he would like to see her keep the ring," an insider told .&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/0cd084915dd3-caro2-z.jpg><p id=e_DIGqIX6CsE data-wc=7><strong>Caroline Wozniacki</strong> <strong>announced her engagement on Twitter</strong></p><p id=eRoFJOdq8brJ data-wc=143>Whether Caroline chooses to sell the ring is not yet known, but other celebrities in the past have&nbsp;taken&nbsp;that step. Demi Moore made no secret that she sold hers for £250,000 after her split from ex-husband Ashton Kutcher. "Almost half of marriages in the UK now end in divorce," said diamond expert Vashi Dominguez on ITV's . "What to do with your old rings is an issue facing millions of women. But <strong>the most popular option is to sell the ring</strong> and buy some further jewellery in its place." A survey conducted by Vashi found that out of 1,000 women, more than a third who had split from their husbands ended up selling their engagement rings, which typically increase in value by 5 per cent each year they are owned. Other options included <strong>re-designing the piece of jewellery</strong> or keeping it.</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
